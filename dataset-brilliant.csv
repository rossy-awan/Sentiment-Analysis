"Love the app, my one major complaint is that you guys change the course content and layout every couple of weeks. Some of us like to feel that we have fully ingested a chunk of content, and not to come back later to find that it has 20% more content now and I either have to spend an hour or two on a basic level course to satisfy my OCD that I have fully covered the fundamentals, or just assume that it wasnt important enough to have been originally included in the course from the start?",5
"I really enjoy the courses, but I have been having a small issue since a few updates back. When I leave the app and open it again, the loading screen shows and keeps loading until I quit the app and restart. This was not an issue a few months ago, and it is just very annoying.",4
"I was really liking this at first, but the lessons appear to jump from one topic to another (doing trig in geometry) with no real guidance. It also seems like the number of courses are diminishing rather than increasing. I was wanting in-depth math guidance from algebra to calculus to shore up my skills, but one gets a little of one topic before moving on to another in an unproductive fashion. Unless this vastly improves, my use of this and my continued subscription is ending.",1
"The content is high quality and easy to understand, I've been using it as a supplement to my other studies and it's been great. However the app is laggy, unreasonably slow to load lessons and tests, and generally a slog to deal with. I often get frustrated with the excruciatingly long load times that will just fail 1/3 of the time. If you're patient it's a good service, if you're doing on the website it's a great service, but mobile is painful. P.S Add a dark mode",4
I started using Brilliant to help prepare me for a math placement test (it's been over 10 years since I've taken a math class) and I'm loving it so far! The lessons are short and to the point and offer visual representation of certain math problems. They are so helpful. My only issue is it has frozen a couple times on me while using the phone app. No issues with the desktop version though.,4
"A great app! The lessons aren't made for children, while still building from a beginner level. They are consise and clear, and very interesting! Edit: I've only been using the free version, but you get a free trial of nine lessons on every subject, so I've had plenty of lessons for the last month without paying anything. I would absolutely recommend this app, and plan on getting the paid version myself!",5
"I would bump up the score if I could actually do more practice or, like, actually redo practice lessons. Currently, if you finish a problem, there is no way to get more practice by resetting the problem it's just a one and done thing which for some of the subjects people need more practice with. There is no way to solidify the information I've learned other than just rereading the lesson, which isn't enough most of the time. Other than that, I do pay more attention compared to a textbook.",3
"Fun and engaging. I absolutely hated school and couldn't wait to graduate, but I was still looking for a way to stay sharp, develop skills, and overall satiate my curiosity regarding different fields of study. I'm currently going through the data analysis course, and it is structured with puzzles throughout that test your understanding of the topic while feeling like a game.",5
"Fun way to learn lots about coding. Enjoyed the lessons as they helped explain how it worked. The only downfall is that after you've gone through some of the lessons, you have to pay for a monthly membership or a yearly membership. I'm disappointed that I now have to either have a membership to use the app or just uninstall it. I truly enjoyed the app and the teaching process it uses.",3
"I searched for ""learn Arduino"". This app returned in the results. I thought ""I've heard of these guys, I'll try it out"". After agreeing to the noise, the app opened up with one page and nothing to do with what I wanted except general coding practices. No way to search for arduino, no menu, no settings. Once it opens you play with only the toys they give you.",1
"After just using this app for one day, I can already see the flaws. First addressing, the system that allows you to actually do the lessons. Limited at a small amount per category, forcing you to pay to keep practicing. It would be neat if instead you could be given the option to view ads to receive more lessons of that type. Another thing that goes along with that is the leaderboard. I just don't get it. Why lock things behind a paywall if it's supposed to be competitive and not based on money?",3
"Excellent app for learning with a focus on real world uses. Nice organization with great animations that make visualizing concepts easier. It's also great that there are plenty of free lessons to try out. At $25/month it's pretty steep, but you could learn a lot in a month and it's cheaper than a traditional class. Khan Academy is also a great choice, but Brilliant seems better for learning on phones and has different topics.",5
"This app is brilliant. I mean both literally and in name. I'd really like to see a series explaining the background of computer graphics to people, how 2D triangles are made to look like 3D environments using the projection matrix. I think this would be the perfect platform to help visualize it, which would make a hard enough subject to learn easier.",5
"I used to read articles and listen to music while taking public transportation to my place of work. Now, I Invest my time on Brilliant. It's a great app to learn new skills or sharpen previously learned skills. Whether you're looking to start a new career path, learn something new, or strengthen previously learned skills, brilliant makes learning fun and competitive!",5
"Relatively simplified basic coding courses. Still on the free trial, don't know if I will continue once it runs out I haven't looked at prices but the system does seem worthwhile, and there are multiple different subjects (called ""learning paths in app) available to study. Soft ranking system against other users for that"" numbers go brrr"" dopamine hit.",5
"Was really liking the lessons until I saw that I have to pay $25/month OR $160 upfront just to progress in a single course. That's way too steep of a price to justify considering the lessons are short and the same information can be found for free and in better formats elsewhere. If you guys added a free tier with ads (similar to Duolingo), I would actually use the app. Deleting until this gets updated.",1
"You're better off using a PC because you won't have issues with crashing. I pay for this service, so I'm going to make sure that I deliver a better user experience to myself, in case the app developers continue to fail to do that. The website itself is fantastic though. 4 stars because I absolutely love learning and for also keeping the desktop site working flawlessly.",4
"This app offers a great user experience. It breaks complicated math concepts down into easy to digestable pieces. I'd recommend it for people who are learning, need extra help, or are refreshing their skills! I'm a mom who needed to relearn math in order to help her son.",5
"App is not free. You hit the pay wall as soon as you barely get into a course. Unusable without paying the subscription. Lesson design looks pretty good, but disappointed in the subscription requirement. In response to the developer: I did not expect all free content, but I did think I would have gotten to do a course or at least more of the course for free/trial without hitting a pay wall on the second day.",2
"Before buying this app I tried using it and after doing the first exercise it was unable to load the next one. It kept saying it's taking too long, try again, but after 2 more times I decided to uninstall it. I am so glad that I tried it b4 buying the app. I can only tell you what I experienced, who knows you might better luck than I. I hope the developers are able to find out what wrong because apps like these are great for my great grandkids. It's better than playing only games.",1
"If it was cheaper or free with ads, I'd think it's a great app. But personally, I found the interactive imagery not all that in depth or helpful, and the explanations are very short. It will only explain a concept to you in one way, so if that way doesn't click with you, you need to learn elsewhere. All that would be fine, but it's a bit much to me for 10$ a month. The lessons are great in terms of reviewing material, but for 1st time learners I think it's a bit lacking.",3
"Brilliant courses are a mixed bag. Some are great, while others feel like filler. For example, the Computer Science Fundamentals course has you calculating pastry-making time and sorting socks. I get that they try to cater to different skill levels, but it gets a little ridiculous. Just be aware that the course quality varies wildly so try before you buy. Edit: Decided NOT to go with the pay plan. I wanted to like it. I really did... just too much filler for me.",3
"EE guy here. App is only good for freshening up on some electrical scientific theory. No way to search for courses, browsing only. No electrical circuit/components courses. I thought ""gee, if it has courses on complex subjects like machine learning/LLMs and quantum mechanics/computing, surely it would have basic electrical circuits/components"". Nope. UX good.",2
"An extremely disappointing app. I can't fit all of my complaints into one review, so I'll go with the biggest issues: 1. lessons are inconsistent. The style and level of explanation vary wildly from one subject to another. 2. The lessons aren't nearly as interactive as you'd expect from the advertisements. For the most part, you have to read a textbook-style explanation, then click a button to answer questions. 3. It frequently quizes you on things it hasn't taught, which is frustrating.",1
"Great app, great content. My only complaint is that most of the content is paid, and the subscription is expensive. I actually considered buying a subscription, but the 20% off promotion was only offered for 2 days after I signed up. It took me more than two days to decide, and I cannot afford the full price. Maybe they'll do another promotion and I'll change my mind, but for now it's a no go. Still a great product though, worth 5 stars... if you can afford it.",5
"How to cancel: the ""Cancel Premium subscription"" button does not work. You have to go to payments, where you finally see the correct cancel subscription button. That takes you to the cancel subscription page, which doesn't scroll. You have to use two fingers, like you're trying to zoom, and only on the bottom part of the page. I have reported the first issue, so maybe that will get fixed. Leaving this here in case anyone like me didn't feel brilliant enough to quit Brilliant.",3
"I recently downloaded this app on a whim because I saw it advertised by someone who does extremely helpful tutorials on YouTube. Bottom line, this is an expensive but highly intuitive learning software which will give you a decent grasp on various concepts in math and science. Obviously, this won't be a replacement for a class, especially if you are pursuing a degree. But if you need to brush up on something or you want to learn a little coding, I would definitely try it.",5
"Blew me away. I love the balance of explanations and interactions. It works perfectly for me. And thank god it's all in SI units. I've learned more math and science in 2 months than I learned in all of high school and college. Biggest drawback is that some of the courses I'm most interested in are only partially completed (with more content ""coming soon, we will notify you"").",5
"I love the app but it is so expensive, you can only do so many free lessons in a corse then you can't go on in that course so you go to one on a different subject and eventually you run out corses you can actually understand, this is very frustrating for me because this app is soooo good, instead of just teaching you a fact that you may never use, it teaches you to think smarter. I would definitely rate 5⭐ if it didn't try and charge $25 a MONTH",3
"I really wish something like this was around when I was younger. I wanted to try brilliant out to see if it would help me spend less time on social media, and it has helped with just that. Instead of mindlessly scrolling through YouTube or Reddit I can zip through a lesson on here and actually learn something useful. My two complaints are lack of a dark mode, the white background can be hard on the eyes sometimes. And sometimes the app has a hard time registering input from the touch screen.",4
"I've been using this for most of the day for the first time. My first experience is it's a well designed app and I'm very interested in learning on it. But my big issue is the pricing. Firstly, I don't have any incentive on purchasing a subscription at the moment because I don't really see one. Next of all, the pricing is high for a subscription. Making it not so student friendly for most of grade school and college students that actually may need it to help them learn/study. My review may change later in the future, but as of now, I can't rate it any higher.",3
"Little do I ever find the motivation to actually work and do anything productive. But, I've finally found the perfect reason to. I love solving equations and finding solutions for certain things, and I love learning more about math in general. Brilliant teaches me a lot of things that school sometimes fails to. If I ever forget something, I can just look back on it. I plan on getting a career in engineering, specifically rocket engineering, and I think that Brilliant is going to be a huge help.",5
"A bit dysfunctional. Scrolling is sticky, downloads don't always work, the app constantly interrupts itself to process payment(sort of tells you everything right there). There are plenty of free lessons and tests through different sites. Brilliant's main offer is that it's very polished material. The real wealth of explanation is in their wiki you can't access directly from the app. Real shame because that part's free online. Not much value in the app.",3
"Visually engaging, fun puzzles. I think Brilliant is probably best used as a supplemental program to formal college instruction, as it seems to assume the user already knows about the lesson topic, and some lessons move too fast (for me) with minimal explanation. So far they are not responsive to feedback regarding lesson content or bugs. Overall i think Brilliant has been fairly helpful at keeping my mind active, but is probably better for college students, not lifelong learners.",4
"I am in love with this app! I am working to break into the web development world, and this has been such a great tool to supplement my learning. Also, I have always wanted to learn calculus and am looking forward to working up to those lessons on the math track. I have been knocking out a few lessons each night before bed and have really enjoyed it so far. Will for sure be purchasing after the free trial.",5
"I've had zero glitches, bugs or otherwise poor experiences with this application. The accompanying website is also simply joy! I only wish this was around when I was a child going through school and onward (it covers basics, intermediate and advanced fields). The ability to focus solely on the topic/puzzle at hand IS Brilliant. One amply named service that should be required in classrooms or very least accompanied with tutoring of the sciences. Do not stop learning regardless of age!",5
"The UI could use a little tiny bit of polish, getting out of courses took, like ONE more second, but im nit-picking only because I dont have that much to nitpick, content is awesome, wish it was free, p.s, was sent here from kurzkazart or however you spell it. And, yea, it's pretty pricey, maybe with more time they can either lower the price for premium, or have some more non-premium stuff so more ppl get hooked and more money for them.",4
"Great idea, very reminiscent of Duolingo which I enjoyed, but it's not free. While Duolingo has a premium subscription you can get, you still get unlimited lessons to learn from with addition of ads and ""lives,"" but this is a paid app advertising as a free learning tool. You only get 6 free lessons and then you have to pay $13+ a month to keep using it (over $160 a year.) Just go to YouTube and learn there, it's free and honestly not a step down from this app.",2
Intuitive to use and promotes an understanding of subjects beyond memorization. Could offer the chance to practice math problems more before moving on to the next topic as sometimes the handful of problems aren't enough to fully grasp what it is I'm looking for. I have had to follow up with YouTube videos to understand some of the mathematical topics.,5
"I am absolutely thrilled with this app! It brilliantly simplifies complex topics, making them accessible to learners at any stage. Whether delving into AI, a subset of computer science, or exploring unexpected areas of interest, it's an invaluable tool for personal growth and knowledge expansion. Highly recommended for anyone keen on self-paced learning without the need for a traditional classroom setting. 😀",5
"The breadth of topics is fantastic, the interactive puzzles are great, and the explanations are pretty good, but as simplistic as this app is (on Android flagship pixels) it sure gets stuck a lot - 'continue' buttons frequently do nothing, pages and interactive charts come up empty, and refresh often doesn't help. It really breaks one's focus ... guess I'll go watch a movie.",3
"In terms of the layout/background visuals, it's extremely basic. This made me overlook it for quite a while, but it is actually a great program for what it is! I wouldn't use it as a way to go from nothing to job-level competent on its own, but I think it's great to get your feet wet in areas you aren't familiar with before you take the plunge with something more dedicated, or as a way to practice things you already know, as most everything is a use it or lose it situation.",5
Don't think it's worth the $10/month. I'm still just using the free version. Don't use the app enough to justify the expense. Use it to pass time instead of browsing social media. The puzzles are fun and I enjoy trying to solve them. Which is why I gave it four stars. Only been using it a couple weeks can't rate the amount of content provided just yet.,4
After canceling my membership I was billed for the app the following year. I sent an email for a refund which was never addressed or even acknowledge. Sent a second email regarding this to no avail. Deleted my app. I sent an email to confirm cancelation and just got another charge this year for the app. Sent an email again this year and recieved another cancelation confirmation. Can't wait to go through this again next year. They prey on people not checking their credit card charges.,1
"2 problem with briiant, I love using it and use it as much as I can but these 2 problems are making it harder for me to continue to use it. 1. dark mode. It's difficult for me to use anything that is lacking a dark mode. 2. Having dyslexia makes it extremely difficult to understand most of the problem because of the amount of reading that is required. I believe the 1st is easy and the 2nd can be solved with eather a reading bot or a voice actor? If these change it will make it so much better-",3
"Brilliant is an excellent educational app. Covering a comprehensive range of subjects suitable for both beginning and intermediate learners, Brilliant is a tool for entertainment, continuing education, and expanding one's curiosity. Structured as a series of quizzes, each topic builds upon previous and more foundational ideas. Although it may be frustrating to guess on a difficult problem before getting further explanation, Brilliant's method ensures you're unlikely to forget the concept!",5
"This app is awesome. It's helped me understand math and science easier than school did, including college. I like that they have the same bite-sized and gamifid approach as Duolingo. However, I feel as though it could provide more engineering courses: electrical, nuclear, and aerospace, just for example.",4
"When first signing up, there were some problems getting access to my account; but then it started working shortly thereafter and everything has been great since then. I'm just getting started but, so far, the puzzles are fun and increasing in difficulty. I retracted my initial review, from when things were not working. Now that it's working, I feel this new review more accurately reflects the app and my interaction with everything.",5
The design looks good visually. I'm sure the content is very good and thorough. But the subscription service required is just a hassle I don't want to deal with. I don't want to subscribe to anything. I don't even particularly want to be subscribed to Netflix but the way television has changed its far more practical. But a one time fee wouldn't be to bad if you just have to charge us.,4
"I have a degree in mathematics, and I am an avid lifelong learner who loves to challenge my mind with mathematical/scientific topics daily, and who HATES to forget concepts that I've already learned. To that end, this is hands down the most useful app I have ever encountered. For me, it's an extremely engaging pocket refresher on 75 percent of the useful math I learned in college, plus tons of new material! There are a couple of annoying glitches but nothing that could take away a 5 star rating!",5
"Essentially I really enjoy this app but I have two opinions of it. 1.) If the price increases at all, I may cancel my annual subscription. 2.) Doesn't seem to be a way to ""quit"" a course and ""clean up"" the home page. As of now I have multiple courses I dabbled in and did not enjoy them, but they plague both my home page and courses page. Insisting that I continue.",5
"Do not subscribe to premium. If it doesn't work out and you request a refund, they will refuse and keep your money. I wasted $130 and I hope you can avoid this mistake. The app itself is visually stunning, which is nice until you realize that's all it is. I've done many lessons now and after each one I couldn't tell you what I actually learned. They focus so much on the visual concepts that they forgot to relate them to actual material.",1
"This has been a great adventure. I work in cybersecurity and never took calculus and physics in high school and have loved learning these topics and brilliant makes it very easy to learn. I could would recommend to parents trying to teach their kids fundamental algebra, geometry or any other STEM topics as it does a great job with visuals and graphics to help them understand.",5
"Grwat idea & puzzles or lessons, but the app is cluttered, clunky, and poorly organized. One must sort through a seemingly endless mess to find areas or lessons he or she moght wish to study, and then theres a good chance those are locked and only available in the paid version. Why would I pay when I can't even sort out the free stuff? I'd try this app out again in the future when its cleaned up and easier to navigate, but for now, it's too cluttered and clunky.",3
"Too many bugs. I am always seeing it validate my purchase when reopening and it was slow to do so. Some modules wouldn't finish! At times, questions involve too much brute calculation. I shouldn't be getting a calculator just to add and divide many individual numbers. The interactive parts I've seen are usually no more than a slider with a basic graphic and it felt cheap after a while. Bought a year (discounted) and it is not worth another at full price or even the discounted.",1
It's been 20 plus years since math class and i struggled to make a's with my dyslexia ( numbers are my weakness more so then letters. I love to read. I cant see numbers in my head like everyone else) recently I've really needed to do a lot of algebra for work. It had been so long I had to relearn what I was doing all over again. This is really helping bring back what I've forgotten.,5
"Oversll the app is sleek and well-designed, with some good explanations of the topics. However this varies heavily by topic. The app is inaccurate and poorly explained in the machine learning and quantitative finance sections I'd also appreciate a scratch paper tab to take notes or work out some calculations. Right now I end up guessing numbers when the calculation is complicated.",3
"Wonderful! Extremely engaging, and as lessons advance complex concepts are really broken down to make them more understandable while not compromising the quality of the lesson. I also like that there are competitive leagues which helps me to stay motivated to learn and keep expanding into deeper topics. I appreciate that you don't have to have a subscription right away to enjoy the app, as that gives you time to evaluate and see if you want to become a subscriber. Great job Brilliant 👍🏼!",5
"I've been using this app for about two years... Recently, there has been some changes... I cannot find the option to post questions regarding the provided answers... Also, there used to be a percentile stats segment which showed your position in each course which I do not see anymore... I even sent an email regarding this issues and there has not been any responses...",3
"Not as intuitive as it seems to be. Lots of arbitrary notations and different yet complicated functions. For example, Algebra 2 was pulling functions learned in precalculus and calculus. Everything was smooth until that point, where they began using seemingly random variables in functions that I had no idea how they'd relate. Also some lessons seem to be out of order, where one comes before the others.",4
"My experience with this app: ""Please let there be a dark mode. Please let there be font face, font size, and margin size controls."" Yeah, no. I hope they're added soon! Of every app I use, I think this is the one where reading and color controls would be most useful, and therefore most surprising they don't exist. I'm a subscriber and intend to continue to be, and I have Force Dark Mode turned on in Developer Settings which does some good but it's buggy and hacky. Quality of life updates please!",3
"This is my favorite way of learning. I don't boast often, brillaint is the easiest way to learn complex theoretical ideals and the range of information is perfect. I agree with another comment that the app itself is difficult to navigate outside of the normal path, but the website is better on a PC. I am learning while having fun.",5
"I paid for a lifetime subscription which at the time was around $500. Then they cancelled it at some point and it's like that option never existed. These people are now trying to force me into a subscription plan without even refunding the ridiculous amount I have already paid. It's not worth the money to begin with. In hind sight I should have just created an Anki account and customized it. Anki free and it is much better than this overrated, overpriced, cashgrab.",1
"Cool idea but the company feels greedy. I paid $80 for a year and I used it for a few months. A year later there's NO autorenew notice and NO notification of charging me another $80. Unacceptable at this price point. I see the $80 renewal on a credit card and contact support, and support tells me it's against ""policy"" to refund purchases which is obviously bs ... but on the positive they did refund the renewal. Use Kahn, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, edX, etc but I'd avoid paid Brilliant.",1
"I enjoy the daily challenges, especially with the reminders. The explanations are short and well written. I usually learn something and while they stretch my mind a little, they aren't so difficult as to be frustrating. So far I can get them right about 80% of the time. I've also started a couple of the courses. They are also well written in short lessons that help make them easy to digest.",5
"I use this app instead of playing mobile games during my breaks at work, ngl; I honestly thought I'd easily grow bored, but so far, it's pretty good and I have learned quite a bit. If I could ask for any improvement(s) to the app, then it'd be text-to-speech so I can listen to the lessons while working. Another thing that I'd personally like is maybe a system that other users of the app could make/post their lessons. Thx Brilliant team!",5
"I'm not sure the issue but this app won't let me sign up for the free trial. Everytime I try to use my free trial it says insufficient funds. It's making me think this is a scam or at the very least deceitful. Cool idea for an app, great and simple interface. Nothing distracting you from what I was able to see. Having to pay for the free trial is a huge red flag though. If I could try the app I'm sure I'd love it but as it stands the free trial isn't free and I can't justify a blind $150.",3
"I'm a self taught software engineer without a degree; I either missed out on or have forget most of the maths and sciences that were taught in high school/college. Brilliant makes learning feel self exploratory and fun. Not only am I able to re learn the basics quickly, but the courses progress to advanced levels(calculus/diffEQ, etc.). The instruction is great, and the breadth of material is impressive.",5
"Overall great app. You'll re-learn just about everything in different ways. Only down side is when I'm on my phone away from home it's saved on a different lesson, than at home on my iPad Pro. Also, sometimes it bugs out with ""Continue"" or scrolling is jumbled to the point a lesson cant be reached on the screen which messes with my progress on a limited schedule. Lastly, cost has risen substantially.",4
"The intentions of the app are great and well executed... When you can use it. During my free trial I had to contact support because some content within the lesson wasn't loading, their advice? Uninstall it and reinstall it. Very helpful, not. I had a subscription gifted to me and when attempting activate it through my email it would just take me to the app to whatever the last page I was on, no way to activate the gift subscription. In the settings menu, the subscription button doesn't work.",2
"It really is a wonderful application that teaches in way that should work regardless of whether you're a visual, auditory or kinetic learner. While it obviously is mostly visual, the diagrams and animations really do a lot to cover the gaps in learning styles. I think they've done an amazing job of making these lessons accessible and understandable to the majority.",5
After trying it out for a few months I'd say Brilliant is good for those wanting an introduction to subjects. It's does not hold up well when you need deeper learning. The pace of lessons can be wildly inconsistent. Sometimes content is presented in small digestible parts. Often times leading questions are asked which can be a bit discouraging because the foundation hasn't been properly established to independently tackle those problems (yet). Worth a try but Khan Academy is a better value.,3
"100% would subscribe to a monthly plan for as much as $14.99/month. But $160 as one payment per year... absolutely not. In this economy, I'm not sure who has that much money on hand to throw at an app at once. I appreciate the free trial, that's a smart move, but only allowing one subscription tier is unfortunate because I won't be throwing $161 at this app at end of my trial in 2 days as much as I'd love to throw $14.99/month at it if that was an option. Great app. Poor subscription model..",3
"Great content, but the app itself is terrible. It doesn't parse LaTeX expressions correctly so a lot of the content shows up as strings of code. It also isn't as easy to navigate as the mobile site. When the mobile site is easier to use than the app, you know something is off. Granted, I am using an older version of Android, but I'd still expect the app to have all of its basic functionality .",2
"The content of the app seems to be very nice but it's very expensive for students like me. I wish I could have free access to all the contents just like in other online courses out there. A few advertisements won't bother me much in the free version. A option for free version with advertisements should be available especially for students. I am really interested in the artificial neural network, machine learning and probability section of the brilliant app.",3
"I want to say it constantly crashes every 4-6 minutes but I click the app to restart it (it does restart almost instantly, thankfully) and it continues to where you were before the crash. Almost seems like it's alt+tabbing itself out. Highly annoying and can break your train of thought. Will bump rating up as soon as that gets fixed. Edit: spoke too soon. Literally 5 minutes after this review, finished a lesson and it froze. Had to force close the app.",1
"This is DEFINITELY the best STEM learning place online! I really love the visual learning method that they use at Brilliant. If you are looking for an amazing, premium learning experience, you are the the right place. There are many different courses to chose from, and yet quality is never sacrificed. I would recommend this app to anyone, from people who are trying to improve their skills to people who want to learn something new.",5
"I really enjoy this app and purchased a year long subscription. My only complaint is that there is no way to disable the streak tracking 'feature.' It takes up space on every page and, for me, is a complete contradiction to the whole no grading aspect. Please consider making this tracking optional - every time it pops up it makes me want to use the app less.",4
"I've done Brilliant every day for the last 34 days, but sadly it's very inconsistent with how fast steps are going. Most of the time you're presented with 1 short example before moving onto the next stage of complexity. It's really discouraging when you feel like you're not grasping it and don't really understand much of the content. 1 example is rarely enough. The pace is quick, and you'll not fully grasp most things unless you put it a lot of time outside the app to understand the content.",2
"It would be a great app, but it is annoyingly buggy for the money. Sometimes, completed quizzes just revert back to zero after one is already on the next one. And sometimes, the continue button does not work without reloading the whole thing. The loading animation also gets stuck sometimes, even if the content was successfully loaded in the background. Frustrating.",3
"Before I discovered brilliant, I wanted to find books nearby that had math-like problems for fun. I couldn't find any such thing. Then I saw brilliant as an ad on youtube.wasn't disappointed at all. In fact, it exceeded my expectations and I am very happy with it. I'm looking forward to get a lifetime subscription when my yearly one is over. A great way to spend your free time in a productive way. Hope they'll post more advanced problems with time once I'm done learning the existing ones.",5
"I'm using a Pixel 2 with brilliant's app. There is a common bug in my application that locks the pages so I can't continue to the next page. I just found a really cool swipe feature so I can get to the next page but it doesn't complete the quiz. The only way that I can resolve this is to close the app and open the app and complete the quiz. This happens once per session or once every other session. Small bug, kind of annoying, but overall a brilliant app",4
"This app is horribly broken. It takes minutes to hours to load the next step in a module! Even if I close it and reopen it, it just goes back to the start of the module and once again takes an absurd amount of time to load the next section! At over a hundred dollars a year, even with a discount, this is completely unexceptable! In addition, this explains problems very poorly for many problems. It's an extremely frustrating app!",1
"Not free AT ALL. I'm sure this is a good app for many, and might even have great levels of challenge. But to say it's free with in app purchases is completely misleading. It's $24.99 a month! I can only rate it one star because of this bait and switch. You go thru the first problem solving routine, and then when ready to solve, it sneaks you into a payment page that one might accidentally accept. What a shame.",1
"several typos and problems with the app version, especially a problem for the asking price. however, i feel it is definitely worth your time if you are trying to learn or reenforce math/logical concepts. instead of telling you how something works and then you repeat it, there are several points where it guides you into figuring out how to do it. truly invaluable for any hardcore math fans",4
"I love the lessons and topics taught in this app. It helped me ""stretch my brain muscles"" and sharpen my problem solving skills. I would rate this app higher, but the app occasionally doesn't save the progress made on Offline Courses. I don't mind solving the quizzes again, but it does mess up my learning schedule. I hope this can be addressed soon. Overall, it's a great app!",3
"I like the concept and where they are taking this but it does have some areas to improve. As others have noted, the offline courses feature needs to be redone. I'd prefer only being allowed 2 or 3 offline courses if, once I finished one, I could delete it and download a new one for my next flight. Making me wait for content I've paid for seems a bit unfair.",3
"I struggle with the learning approach of Brilliant. I prefer to know a lot of information up front, but sometimes the questions literally want you to provide a guess and say ""you'll learn how to do this later"". I fail to see how that helps me learn, but maybe it does work for others. There is also no dark mode. Overall, I appreciate the structured lessons, but they sometimes don't jive with me. Lack of dark mode makes it annoying to use this app after my partner has fallen asleep.",2
"I've been using this app (premium) consistently for the past three months to review calculus and trigonometry concepts to improve my math foundations for my upper level calculus course. I find that it's a very good refresher - and decently good at teaching new material too, though that's not what I've been using it for. The app is well-designed to get you solving problems, but that can be hard work, just like it is in school! Yet, just because it isn't always fun doesn't mean it isn't working.",5
"Not very engaging and overpriced. I signed up for a 7 day trial which required my credit card. I did a couple puzzles, but mostly didn't have time for it. During that week, I received lots of app notifications to the point that it was an annoyance. However the billing notice came as an email through Google play. I was charged $150 for a year, the only subscription option. I did a few more puzzles as I had time, decided I didn't like it. I asked for a pro-rated refund, but support was unhelpful.",1
"Most of the courses are super fun, although some have obviously better scaffolding than others. The most fun are Game Theory, the calculus series, and the logic series. My least favorites have to be one or two in the computer science thread and parts of the stats course--they're probably still good for users who already know these fields pretty well, but I find them a bit hard to follow (some of their fundamentals aren't elaborated enough and practice is insufficient).",5
This app/site is err... brilliant! I love learning using puzzles and this has all the principles I'm interested in learning. It's a great refresher on physics and enabling me to learn new things like astrophysics in an intuitive way. I found it hard to learn anything from lectures so mainly did it through reading books and putting what I learn into practice. This cuts straight to the chase: learning by doing and applying principles using clever puzzles.,5
"Fairly good app. It's a bit expensive, in my opinion. But I did by a subscription. The reason I gave it a 3-star review is due to logic used in the math problems being sub optimal. When I learned math, I was taught to find the solution through the easy possible way. Instead, they have you testing ransom numbers to find a variable rather than working the problem backward.",3
"The app looks great from what I've seen online and through YouTube. Definitely recommend if you're struggling in a major topic like calculus or biochemistry, but if you're just trying to expand your knowledge, I'd stick to YouTube just because of costs. It's not that expensive, but just considering how frequently you'd truly set time for it to expand, YouTubes a better path. I somewhat feel like it'd be better with something like SAT passes, get out of cost based on scores, and just have ads.",4
"I'm somewhat disappointed in the course selection and wish the courses would go further and teach more. They're great for a cursory introduction, but you're left wanting more. My biggest disappointment is their use of advertisement trackers. As if their subscription isn't already expensive, they subvert your privacy to make more money by letting Google spy on you while the app is open. If you protect your privacy by blocking these tracking requests, the app is very, very slow to load courses.",2
"An amazing app. Whether you want to learn something you've never studied, quickly brush up on a topic you have, or test yourself, this is the perfect place to do it. Great layout, and above all it is interactive - you don't learn unless you do, and you do a lot here. Highly recommend the premium subscription for full enjoyment, it's a very reasonable price for knowledge.",5
"This app would easily be 4, maybe 5 stars, except for one glaringly huge fault. You can't start over. If you start learning a subject, give up, and try coming back, good luck. You can't even delete and recreate an account without paying more money. I tried doing this, I'm paid out another 5 months, and they're asking me to pay again. Stupid, stupid design for an app I really enjoyed!",2
"if i lookup a topic and come back later it's gone, and it doesn't show up in recent. Even worse, the app does not maintain state. If I'm trying to read something, and I tab away and come back, the view reloads. Then I have to go find where I left off. Very frustrating, and there is no reason for this.",1
Way better than i expected to be honest. i may have tried the app a few years back and it didnt really leave an impression. it wasnt until i saw one of their ads that visualized mathematical concepts easily that drew me to revist it. The look and feel is extremely modernized. The courses are really easy to understand and actually I really like how they have a free version that you can check out while you decide if you would like to get the full product. Math has litterally never been this easy.,5
"Not the best app for LEARNING. It tends to ask test questions, then cover the material instead of explaining before testing. If one answers wrong, it won't allow one to correct mistakes. Psychologically, that could become discouraging. I got the wrong answer because I didn't know what a scatter plot is. Holding the mouse over key words makes an information window pop up. Since I didn't realize that, I now have to live with the wrong answer because of missing information.",1
Dropped out of college during my final semester after COVID hit and this program has been a godsend. Everything is learn at your own pace and you are free to hop around to whatever subject you may be curious about on any given day. The lessons are bit-sized and intuitive with helpful explanations for when things don't quite click. 10/10 would recommend!,5
"For whatever reason, I thought Brilliant was free, or at least had a free with ads option. But, nope! They will charge you after a ""free"" 7 day trial. I can't afford to pay monthly for optional learning. I'm not a student otherwise the app would likely have some personal value to me.",2
"Could've been great but uses predatory subscription plans. I've been using duolingo for over 400 days in a row (heck yeah keep that streak alive) and they allow a free version with plenty of ads to cover their costs. Brilliant not only tries to trick you into a costly annual subscription ($165), but their free version doesn't even allow you to keep using the platform with ads. You're locked out from learning after 4 or 5 lessons. It's a shame veritasium recommends this trash",1
"I don't remember there being an agreement about a $130 premium subscription starting after a trial of what I thought was a free app. I can't even log into my account because they won't send me the password reset link, (it's not in spam or any other category) just ads about the app that I apparently agreed to pay for but haven't even completed one lesson for. I have ADHD and just wanted to try an alternative learning experience that might help me feel like less of a lazy idiot.",1
"If you really look at the way this app is designed and the explanations that go with the teachings in some sections, it starts becoming an issue of understanding what they're doing. For example, just look at how their ""Learning path, math foundations 7 courses"" is laid out. 1. Intro to algebra 2. Algebra through puzzles 3. Geometry 4. Geometry fundamentals 5. Algebra 2 6. Mathematical fundamentals 7. Pre-algebra. Now tell me how you'd navigate this course.",2
"This app is phenomenal! I am going through the calculus course and I really approve of its teaching style, pacing and content. I am a math major and I have seen calculus taught it lots of ways. I've tutored others in it myself many times but I've never seen explanations as clear and engaging for new and intermediate calculus students as the ones on Brilliant. The App is also very well structured and gives daily encouragement to keep learning and succeeding. It's very well thought out!",5
"Installed to try it out and was immediately frustrated. I want to find a specific lesson that was advertised, but there appears to be no search anywhere in the app. I build apps and searches professionally. It's not that hard. It also doesn't let you see anything but the lession list until you try something, so you waste one of your free lessions picking something you don't want because, again, no search. I do not recommend. If the first 5 minutes are this bad, why should I give any money.",1
"Signed up for a free trial, then got hit with a whole year premium subscription. This is setup to be a subscription scam. It should not charge you for a full year when I never selected that option. I hate all this ""free"" trial BS. I want my money back. The lessons for what I was interested in learning about aren't even useful.",1
"Update: after more time wirh the app, I'm deducting a star because too often it seems like the questions are either poorly structured or deliberately vague, so they're either not carefully constructed (which is essential to logic problems) or they're trying to ""trick"" you, which isn't testing logic so much as speculative reasoning. It becomes more frustrating than challenging.",3
"This is a great app for learning. It allows you to interact with the actual problems, and it tells in a very understandable manner of what is happening, and why, it has helped me learn many things and continue to, and maybe you need premium for it function super well but it is worth it. Thank you brilliant for helping me learn.",5
"The app won't load the practice sessions for the first level of math. I tried over multiple days to work with support to get past it, but while they acknowledge it's a problem, there's not a lot of interest in fixing it. I'm really glad there was a free trial, because if I'd actually paid for this, I'd be angry. Edit: I got the practice sessions to load by multiple un/reinstalls, but then the app interrupted what I was doing to beg for a review. Here's my review: don't do that.",1
"I love how simple it is to use and how good it is at teaching, but the main issue is there is no actual monthly subscription or free version and the only premium that they have is an annual one that is over $100 and it tries to label it as around $10 or $13 a month (depending on the version) and I don't know about some people, but I do not have over $100 laying around so I can get the annual subscription. I really wish I could give it a better rating, but they are just too money demanding.",1
"I downloaded this application because it presents itself as a way to learn concepts in mathematics & physics. However, this app is only going to be useful to people who already are well versed in such & have great appreciation for such. It is not a learning app, it is a review & quiz format. It does not track progress or reinforce ideas already learned. It is not designed to meet the users' level of understanding or even offer information. It presents problems, & explanations that only apply to those problems. If you miss assumptions or don't understand concepts, a link in the app is provided to a wiki style knowledge base. It doesn't point you to where you might need to look, you have to search for yourself. In other words, it is EXACTLY the same experience as if you bought a used textbook to pore over. Anyone thinking about downloading this app is better off doing exactly that. Don't waste your money.",1
"I want to give appreciation to the feedback team, I submitted a request asking for it to be possible to opt out of leagues and they gave a personal response and took me out and I really appreciate it. The app is wonderful if you like solving puzzles and logic problems, and they are often presented as stories and challenges that are a lot of fun. It helped me finally understand really cool things too like how the pythagorean theorem was discovered and made me rediscover how amazing math can be.",5
"Explanations are written for people who already know these things and don't appear until you've already answered. There's virtually no context around questions, so if you don't already know the material, good luck! If I wanted to guess my way into success, I'd go on a game show where at least I might win something for my guessing. I don't know if you consulted educators before making this app, but you ought to find new ones if you did. Also, the app doesn't scale correctly on my phone. Bad UX.",1
I don't usually rate (or buy) apps but brilliant is worth it. I had always wanted to advance in mathematics but had no classes available. I tried to read books by myself but they aren't typically written clearly. Brilliant was even better than I expected. It teaches mathematical strategy as well as information. It's worth more than it costs and I recommend it to anyone.,5
The interface is smooth. I enjoy the Taylor learning curve paired with the flow of lessons. I'm hoping that the lessons become more challenging as my proficiency increases! I recommend this app to anyone wanting to have a casual easy to train their brain and become more pragmatic in real world situations. It's incalculably valuable to understand the subtle unspoken nature of forces and interactions at work in our world and the Brilliant service is extremely inviting. Please continue your love!!!,5
"The lessons are extremely intuitive and well built. I've tried other self learning options and this one is my fave so far. The price without a promo code is VERY steep so I recommend finding your fave math/science youtuber and getting the discount. Even then its still kinda up there, but the lessons are QUALITY. Even reviewing the things I already know have been eye opening. It never assumes prior education like some platforms do and simplifies complex ideas in such an elegant way.",5
"I really enjoyed this app. I played through most of the free levels. I'm not going to commit to a subscription because I'm not sure how much time I can devote to the lessons right now. However, the levels I tried definitely kept me engaged. Easy to understand, informative, and entertaining. Great way to learn and refresh your knowledge. Highly recommended.",5
"Seems like a very good idea, but if you have compromised eye sight this will make you struggle at times. Some pages are fine, especially the ones with more text than pics. Sometimes the text is too small. I struggle a bit to use it, even with my glasses....and there's so much wasted space on the page, they could totally up the font size.",3
"Lessons seem decent, but above all there doesn't seem to be a search function. For instance if you're looking to learn binomial distribution you can't search for it specifically within the app even though there is a specific lesson for it. What's really annoying is that that function does exist but the only way I could access it was going through the unsubscribe/cancelation process.",1
"Cool and is great for its purpose. But its not free and a little pricey for the content imo. Im sure the developers put in a lot of time devising these questions from different areas of study, but they fail to realize that majority of users would probably be interested in only 1 or 2 subjects. I just don't think that fundamentals practice in any 1 subject is worth$25/mo or even $10/mo in annual subscription.",3
The app seems to function quite well for its intended purpose however the range of answers the app will accept is quite limited. For instance when I entered 7 units cubed it told me I was wrong and that the correct answer was 7 by itself only to then explain that the area of the cube increased by 7 CUBIC units. Furthermore when I entered .75/.5 as 3/2 it marked this as wrong only taking the unsimplified .75/.5. Good app but it would be better if there were some extra correct answer options.,4
"I don't really keep too many apps on my phone for too long, unless they are adding value to my life. I really enjoy this app. I am an engineer, and like logical reasoning based on newly learnt information. It helps me do that. Problems are well described so that people with diverse background can be brought to the same page, and use their reasoning skills to solve problems.",5
Needs to have some kind of a free option. No way am I signing up for such an expensive subscription without having played some puzzles and decided if I like. I really would be interested but would have to play with it a bit to see if I even want to upgrade to a paid subscription. You're not doing much to make education available if you want to charge a bunch of money without any kind of free option.,1
"Fantastic learning app with fantastic, honest customer service! I đid find the content to be a bit báic for my current ẽxperience level, so i decided not to kêep it going -- However I accidentally let the subscription run and auto rẻnew. Check this: When i went to cancel they askwd why and I indicated that i had accidentally let the subscription renew and they AUTOMATICALLY began a refund transaction. Incredible. I hope everyone else will take notes (adobe)",5
"I was always interested In computers and how they work and would tinker with the hardware inside but because I did not do well with Math I couldn't take Computer Science classes to learn how to write software. Brilliant makes it easy for me to understand that x=x+y means 1,(read the program and write to Y a value of 1). Brilliant right? I just wish it (Brilliant) had a voice to talk to so it doesn't feel like I'm just reading a textbook.",5
"I love this app. The content is easy to digest, the learning sections are a perfect length, and they added a gamification aspect with leaderboards and streaks. I understand some computer science topics that never really clicked for me because the app developers design the material to be visually appealing, engaging, and simple without sacrificing the important concepts at hand. I'm really looking forward to going back through the math courses",5
"Really useful and good content but I can't get my courses to download offline. Tried downloading the probability fundamentals course and it tried, then just disappeared from the 6 courses I could download. I thought I could fix this by updating the app, but when I updated, the option to download my courses offline just disappeared. Now I'm about to go on a flight where I was looking forward to learning, but I can't use brilliant now. Disappointing if they removed the ability to study offline",3
"I've been enjoying this overall; good format, and the explanations for the most part are easy to follow. Unfortunately it recently stopped working. It's just stuck on the loading screen forever. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled with no change. Super frustrating since I've already paid for the membership.",4
Been using Brilliant for less than a week and I love it! Using it just for fun and to re-sharpen my math/science/thinking skills. Lots of new perspectives that I definitely was not taught in school! Looking forward to getting into some of the more advanced and challenging courses.,5
"I love the foundational math. It's basically all high school math. It has some math widgets that you can play with to get a sense of how all the angles and measurements feel when using a real instrument like a radar. I wonder if it would be enough for me if I wasn't already decent at math, though. For me it's like a review.",5
"No dark mode. No community features at all. I bought a family membership for my kids and I, and we cannot share our progress with each other at all in any way even slightly. I was looking for something like Duolingo, but for math/science instead of learning languages. This app (Brilliant) is not at all like that. It's very lacking in basic features, and I'm surprised it's paid only and not free.",3
"I struggled with Math in High School. I always felt intimidated thereafter. Brilliant has given me a way to engage deeply with mathematics and track my progress in a way that removes friction between the concepts and me-as-learner. Math requires patience and error to internalize. The feedback loop between me trying to do a particular problem and determining if I understood the problem is so much shorter, which encourages me to test my own assumptions when I get something wrong.",5
"Dissappointing. After submitting multiple feedbacks regarding separate issues in a particularly ill-explained lesson, I have no response--none. It has been over a month and probably 2 or 3 months now. It is hard to get excited about continuing when they obviously would rather just earn money instead of make good content--I feel remarkably unbrilliant for choosing a 6-month package.",1
"I remember being in a physics class in 2019 and recommending this app, so the big thing that killed this app for me is the price hike on the subscription service and the elimination of community based problems. I found so much insightful and provoking thought on mathematics and physics by reading and practicing problems by the community. But now it's gone... due to character limits I'll end it there but there is a lot more to say. I also remember when a sub would be under $80 for a year... sigh",1
"Well worth the $ I started math over with pre-algebra after moving all the way to pre-calculus and realizing how shaky my foundation was. This app and web platform are gold, pure gold. The teaching style is so easy to understand and the breakdowns are perfectly executed. This is the only learning app you need. Way better than Khan Academy, And well worth the price.",5
"I signed up for the free trial, and I was set up . I canceled before the alloted time, plus no notifications were sent to me before charging my credit card for an expensive service of $128. Even though I didn't use the service during my trial, support was not able to grant me a refund. Warning to all who choose a trial base subscription",1
"Even though I've cancelled this app keeps trying to bill me $129 over and over. I even got a message saying hey, if your billing fails again we're going to cancel your subscription, and yet VIOLA here we still are... And no option to contact support for assistance. The class work was never preschool level and did not seem worth even going past day 2 of the trial which I'm TRYING TO CANCEL!",1
"Where does the money go? Seems like a good idea and if it was cheap it would be well worth $2-3 or so per month. But with a buggy interface and high price tag you're far better off on Khan academy, Lumosity or another cheap/free option. I'd never settle for less than pristine performance and exorbitant value at this exorbitant price.",1
"Clearly, this is a scam. I opted to try the app. Within a day of too many glitches, I decided it was not for me and tried to cancel my subscription and deactivate my account. 2 weeks later, and it will not allow me into the app nor cancel the subscription and is still trying to charge my credit card. Unacceptable. I do not want the app. Stop trying to take my money. Not to mention. If you don't give the app at least one star, they won't allow you to post your review.",1
"I'm using this service to refresh my memory on number theory and calculus. Number theory for a deeper understanding as I learn vedic mathematics, to impart new tools with my students (I'm a tutor, it never hurts to have extra tools). Calculus I am refreshing as I continue into higher level calculus, physics, and engineering classes towards my degree programs. professors in these subjects can tend to be a little less enthusiastic than most sciences, so this is a very useful tool.",5
"Great way to brush up on old knowledge, as well as learn new tricks and tools you may not have learned for a solid mathematical foundation. Using these lesson can make the more intimidating courses a breeze to understand. Keep your brain in tip top shape with daily problems and puzzles, and track your progress in each area to feel a great sense of accomplishment. I love it!",5
"This is a terrific app full of fun and thought provoking concepts that has put at least in my mind, a new perspective on learning broad and basic principles ranging in various courses through an elementary point of view. It makes learning hard concepts much easier in short periods time. if dummy's guide books had an app this is it. I am really happy I have found this app. Highly recommend and I wished I had found it earlier on! Big thanks for the creators who made this possible!!",5
Content is exclusively for people without understanding in the topics and isn't useful as a refresher. Question design is full of double negatives. If there are multiple solutions the simplest solution won't be in the list. Tons of fluff text and boiler plate in every lesson. Layout and design are being generated programmaticly and are kinda wonky. Calc spent more time practicing the precal decreasing size boxes than practicing actual integration.,1
"This app is excellent. Its organized, full of useful content, intelligent but not overbearing and the most interesting thing about THIS app is that if you want to keep it simple you can, without a loss of functionality or even understanding. However, if you want in depth explanations they are easily available and accessible in app.",5
This is a great app for catching up on some of those old college courses that you might have forgotten. Also a great way to learn some new material while offering a bit of friendly competition with the leagues. Worth the monthly fee for the courses and technical knowledge that it teaches.,5
"Great 5* content but the cost puts premium far out of my reach. 25$ a month or 120 a year. Way too expensive, why is monthly so much more? Think economy of scale or ideal pricing. If you want challenging content regardless of cost this is great but I have a budget that won't allow this. If they reduced costs to something affordable I will reconsider. Might result in multiples more people and profit. I have a family and just wanted a nice intellectual app like this. Thanks anyway. 😟",2
"Good app, but their cancel link in the app does not work which is shady. It disables on click, but does nothing. Edit: CS manually cancelled. I should not need to screenshot what a ""disabled link"" looks like; it is a link that is disabled-- it can no longer be clicked and its color is muted like a disabled link. I tried multiple times across multiple days and same issue. Android v13.",3
"App is kind of slow. Courses have extremely inconsistent pacing and quality. Seems much better for a refresher or review than as a way to learn something new. Too expensive for what it provodes. Maybe if they spent as much on improving the app and content as they do on advertising, it would be worth the price.",2
"this is a fabulous app in my opinion, however it's far too expensive. I've been wanting to brush up on my knowledge in order to go to school again, but i can't afford this app... i do feel as though it was quite effective at its job though. if you have a decent amount of extra cash this is great, but that's the issue with pursuing higher education isn't it. if you aren't rich enough you get left behind. :[",2
The app only allows me to subscribe to a yearly subscription instead of the month to month sub or advertises... I dont have $120.00 to spend on something I'm not sure I'll stick with past a month. I'm also not sure why I have a countdown timer to start my free trial. Feels like I'm being punished for peeking at the subscription fee and forced into something sooner than I otherwise would. Looks like a great product but your marketing approach kills all faith/interest in it.,1
". The only reason it didn't get 5 stars, in my opinion, the graphics and visuals are kind of stale, maybe add in optional video links, and links to some research papers would make this a 5 star app. Great app for learning complex subjects. The content is expansive, and teachs in clear to the point technique",4
"This app is definitely prefered for learning more advanced topics. Brilliant offers a wide variety of courses to study on. However, to advance a lesson, you must buy their premium version. I get why they do this, but I wish I could continue without paying. I'll come back to this app if I need it, and if I'm ready to pay",4
I often know the answer but cannot enter it on my phone. I think paying for this app would be a waste of money it doesn't really seem to work with a phone. My Motorola g(60) and a friend's iPhone could not enter the solution to several equations. We would check to make sure we had the problem right and when you would check it by click hint it to solve it would confirm this but there was no way to enter the solution. Maybe this works better on a computer or tablet. Just not worth it.,1
"Completed almost all the free content before using one of the many, many youtube sponsorship links to get the annual for ~$130 (that's cheaper than Amazon prime). So far I've been kinda going all over the place with it and it's been helping me review things I haven't done in years as well as catch up in areas I missed.",5
"Another dumb basic ""game-ified"" learning app that doesn't actually teach you much of anything past the most trivial points. You can't change the difficulty of the course or try lessons ahead in the course. No trial, or at least it can't be started on mobile. It's the raid shadow legends of learning apps",1
"It's really great for adults who failed math as a kid. The explanations are great, and I love the visuals. Also I don't feel pressured to buy the add-ons. If they made a base pack for 5 bucks (with 5ish units of my choice), I would buy it, though. Mostly because I can't afford a million subscriptions (maybe something for the creators to think about!)",4
"Overpriced. Does not offer refunds or provide renewal warnings. I paid for the full experience for a year, forgot about it six months in. Didn't budget my tiny income for it. I requested cancelation/refund within hour of the charge, but was rejected and now I'm over-drafted 100$ I won't be getting for at least the next 2 weeks. Kind of a PITA to learn from too, compared to competitors like Skill Share and Khan Academy.",1
"I'm a mathematician and teacher. I've used Brilliant both for my own continued learning and to challenge my more advanced students. They're problem-based courses are an excellent way to build understanding, and they are adding more resources all the time. Highly recommended.",5
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I was hoping to brush up on the parts of academic math that we all get rusty on away from school. I have always struggled with typical instruction of principles that aren't actively used in real world applications but this app is a hasty conglomerate of useless exercises. The explanations don't match the questions they present, not do the explain the why of what is going on. They run an excellent advertising campaign but the product is not worth the memory it occupies.",1
I really like this App!! It uses different day to day possible interactions to help you understand whats being set in front of you. In a step by step manner that breaks down the subject of interest like layers of a cake!! Daily lessons and many more lessons free. Just a little bit pricey for me for a subscription.,4
"I'd been looking for an app like this for some time. Heard about it from the YouTube channel Engineering Explained. Simple interface, no ads and a smart, well laid out curriculum. I'm a EE by education and want to keep my math skills sharp and critical thinking exercised. This is also a decent complement to other study materials when preparing for the GRE. Only downside, it's a little pricey but worth it IMO, especially if used daily as I have been doing.",5
"i won't say it doesn't work. i will say it doesn't work for me--which i discovered only after paying for the $100 yearly subscription. at first i thought i was just too dumb to understand advanced scientific concepts. then i started taking the algebra course as a refresher, and the way algebra is explained on this app is just incredibly confusing. and i was good at algebra in school! So i can only determine that this method does not work for my learning style.",2
"Brilliant's support team resolved my issue and I am now happily enjoying my one year subscription to their courses with no complaints. Fantastic resource for pulling yourself away from ""doom scrolling"" and makes phone time feel less like a waste of time and more of an engaging experience with knowledge you can take away from it. Fully satisfied, thank you.",5
DO NOT USE THE 7-DAY FREE TRIAL!!! So I found only minor bugs in the Maths course on the mobile app during the 7-day free trial. I therefore decided to cancel my 12-months subscription. After the 7-day free trial ended I got charged for the 12-months anyway. I received the refund of the subscription but I still had to pay my bank a currency conversion fee since the money on my bank account are not in USD. So basically I got ripped off with the amount of the conversion fee I had to pay my bank.,2
This is an absolutely awesome app that I have missed in the past. This is the ultimate gift for those who are passionate about math and science. I am using this app while taking CS classes and it often does a better job at explaining concepts than my professors. I subscribed recently and I can't wait to discover more. Great job.,5
THIS IS THE BEST it helps you with science and math. I'm in 5th grade and creating computer programs and doing algebra if you get one wrong it explains how to get the right answer without saying it outright it even gives you lessons according to what your struggling with or doing great at from simple cooking science to pre algebra and computer science I love brilliant,5
"""More intuitive learning""; ""Interactive lessons""... my butt! Many lessons have left me more confused than any textbook I've used. You get terms and constants introduced out of nowhere, and for a lot of lessons the most interactivity you'll find are multiple choice questions, over and over. You might stumble on the right answers using very wrong methods and you'll be none the wiser. That's a BAD THING when you're trying to learn.",2
"It is quite ironic that an app teaching software development is this buggy. Constant bugs, unresponsiveness, slow/interrupting animations. The lessons and content are good (I'm only doing math as of yet), but I shouldn't have to file a bug report every time I open the app. This is essentially a paid app, with a VERY steep monthly cost to afford paying half of YouTube to talk about it. Fix the bugs, and I'll update the review. Lower the price and it's a 5/5!",2
"Useless without subscription. Only one short basic module (like trial) of each trajectory is available is available for free. If you wanna learn anything, you have to pay quite a bit. I found subscription too expensive for the offered content where you can't practice much, would rather pay the same for learning platforms where there is better practice environment as well.",1
"The app experience is terrible. Lessons load slowly or outright fail to load even on 4G mobile data. When a lesson is completed, it restarts again instead of going to the next module. When clicking to check league progress, the entire app hangs and crashes. The app is a stark negative contrast to the smoothness of the browser experience on a proper desktop PC. It really detriments trying to do lessons on the go.",2
"Its fun and challenging and opens a different way of thinking. But wasnt using it often enough (busy with work, life many other hobbies) and then the subscription service becomes not worth it. I dont understand why nowadays everything is subscription service, back in the days you just pay for a piece of software (usually around 50 bux) and then you could use it whenever. Its also not really updated that often to warrant a subscription based service. On the current state I would not recommend it.",3
"It is brilliant! So far I've had 4 active days on the app. Courses are great and entertaining, not to mention how well it builds new subjects onto previous tasks. Explanations are spot on and easy to understand. Looking forward to the hardcore subjects. :) Also, it helps me learn the language on another level which is one more reason to thank the devs!",5
"Didn't want to unsubscribe but had to. This app is not optimised to run on my Samsung Fold 4. It chews through the battery and runs hot after 30 minutes of use, resulting in slow response and animation lag. I absolutely loved the lessons and was learning a lot, but paying a yearly sub for a simple app that may never be optimised to run on older phone/tablet models just isn't worth it.",3
"Really fun and a learn through play approach. But I would wish that their content for certain subjects run deeper to help. I'm on the cs, programming route and would like to be able to have a deep understanding of the topic through brilliant instead of having to go through another program to re learn it when brilliant's content runs out.",4
"I have an annual paid subscription and the courses aren't loading. I tried all of the basic troubleshooting and it didn't fix the issue. It stopped happening after a couple of days. I'm just glad there wasn't anything important I needed to study at the time. I appreciated having time to think for myself. It reminded me that a simple app like is okay, but not a good answer for becoming brilliant.",3
"Better than any teacher I have EVER studied under. The explanations and exercises from these courses made me able to do the math I struggled with in college WITHOUT EVEN USING PAPER OR A CALCULATOR! Brilliant teaches you the foundational principles that help you UNDERSTAND, rather than the memorize and regurgitate method of our school system. One thing id love to see would be a timed and an infinite mode for practicing math problems back to back, one after the other.",5
"Brilliant is not that great of a source of learning,in my opinion.the courses seem incomplete and lackluster, the explanations do a bad job at explaining many things, especially more complicated stuff. The pricing itself is horrendous, you get charged an exorbitant amount for what ive seen be described as a glorified text book. There is a leaderboard system which is just pointless, because it doesnt do anything. Its like duolingo but for more than langauges, you might think its good, but its not",1
"Been enjoying it so far! Nice review of concepts that I have not practiced in a very long time. Lessons are concise, and still allows for learning and understanding to happen. Gamifying these concepts makes learning fun - I'm actually enjoying learning math again! Looking forward to getting to more challenging content.",5
"The app itself is not so bad. It has potential to be something worthwhile with a lot of fixing. Constant bugging is so annoying and the lessons are not comprehensive and logically linked to each other. The worst thing is that I was tricked into subscription. I tried free trial given to Ali Abdaal's readers and then canceled the subscription, however I was charged a YEARLY subscription despite me having canceled it. Such a shame and definitely not worth the money.",1
"The app itself works fine, but the courses have a nasty habit of asking a question and then only teaching you after you've gotten them wrong, making you guess and then ask why. I wish it would give you the option to skip ahead by answering questions instead. It feels so much like having not studied for an exam, and it feels cruel.",2
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5/5 The Brilliant app has completely transformed my learning experience! I love the focus on interactive problem-solving in math and science. The lessons are engaging, and the ability to learn at my own pace keeps me motivated. The user interface is sleek and easy to navigate, with no performance issues. The quizzes and real-world applications help reinforce concepts effectively. I highly recommend the Brilliant app for anyone looking to expand their knowledge in a fun and engaging way.",5
"Well thought out built. Simple and intuitive. Most importantly, each session is perfectly sized for busy individual's daily rhythm unaffected. Please add more advanced topics in Physics, Math, Computer Science, Electronics, Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics, Computer Vision, AI, Quantum Mechanics, Robotics, etc. Also, professional certification on each of the above topics as a logical extension of the journey. Lastly, please consider reducing the price and some bugs here & there ;)",5
1. Too many bugs. I keep reporting them but it keeps coming. Hey I'm not your tester. The fact that they have an option to report any bugs on nearly every page says it all. 2. Built in biases. 3. Poor UX/UI. I have to click around to figure how to do something instead of focusing on how to solve the problem/question. Will use it for another month but if they don't fix these I'll be cancelling. For the price you pay its not up to par technically. Running on a Samsung Galaxy S8 Tablet.,3
"This app is brilliant My dad bought the annual subscription for me(I wanted the brilliant subscription ) and the courses are really good. I started the solving equations math course and at the start it was easy, but it got harder as I progressed. Also the interactivity with the lessons is really good. There is also some useful info about computer science which is interesting. The only bad this that they removed the today section for everyone. That's my review of brilliant org.",4
"It doesn't make one brilliant, but rather - it forces you to learn their own concept of brilliance, you get confused cause you're not very brilliant enough to understand some of the concise things they are saying. In the long run, you don't get brilliant by advancing in the lessons, you just read whatever they have to say and you move on. The concise exercises and explanations are not simplified enough for everyone, it's meant for people who are brilliant already and just need refreshers.",2
"I really like this app! As a 12-year-old, I first thought that this app was just another learning game, but then I realized that these lessons are a big brain challenge! These lessons are really not meant for kids, and I struggled to complete the quantum physics lessons. I really recommend this app to those who like a challenge, but with fun! Thanks, Brilliant!",5
"I really appreciate the interactive and engaging way Brilliant teaches complex topics. The design is clean and visually appealing, making it easy to navigate and focus on learning. However, as a university student, the cost of the Pro plan is a significant barrier. I wish there were more flexible options to access the full range of features. I'd love to see more affordable plans or free trials for students to truly experience the full potential of Brilliant.",5
"It's really helpful, made me see math in a different way. In the past, even looking at numbers gave me headache but after doing some lessons with this app, that changed. Now I understand math better. However, I can't access the payment options, I think it's because of my location. So, please, make it possible to have an alternative way to access paid courses for us who can't pay, maybe integrate ads or idk.",3
"I got this app mainly to use on my daily train commutes. However since I don't have good connection I can't enjoy the app. There is no reason to require fast connectivity for these courses, that are entirely premade. Please add an option to download a few courses to still be able to use the app offline. I don't care about the stupid leage thing either. I just like learning. I would prefer it, if there was an option to turn it off. I love the courses, just wish you added preferences like these.",3
"I thought it was for quick learning by mostly practice, but it turns out to be a lot of reading. During registration, it asked me what I'm interested in, but the course content is ordered by other topics to the top. The ""continue"" button must be clicked continuously at the bottom of the screen but probably should be positioned within easy reach of thumbs. All pictures should have labelled items if those items are going to be referred to in text. I have other feedback but no space left.",1
"The app is impressive and the information is great... however... if you are having difficulty understanding a concept (and there are some tricky concepts to grasp) there is no help at all or knowledge checks to assist in your learning. I want to love this and I did purchase a year's subscription in advance, and am pushing through, but for some advanced concepts I question if there is enough assistance for ""beginners"".",3
"This should be great, the courses are mostly great and explain concept well, but the app and content is desperately in need of some QA. Loads of usability bugs such as drop-down lists not working and then scrolling to a random part of the page. Often you can't answer the questions because you're not given the same info that is in the ""why?"" section. Sometimes these sections contradict what's in the main content. Occasionally there is an option to report an error but this doesnt always appear.",3
"I've had a subscription for a year and a half. and I can tell you this application is horrible! It's fine for the beginning, but as soon as you get into trigonometry not to mention calculus anything even remotely difficult - the explanations are so bad I can't even put it in words. The so-called exercises are simply multiple choice guesses most of the time. This is a waste of time don't even bother",1
"It's saying there is a limited time discount but there isn'The questions are well thought through and explained. I learned more in an hour than I did at school. Love the visual interpretations of the questions, makes it so much easier to grasp. Playing with the free version. This app is awesome, I'd love to subscribe but it's a bit too pricey. I'm sire it's worth it but I'm a casual user so paying over a hundred quid a year is too steep added to all the other subscriptions this life sends at us.",3
"I'm using a trial month, and damn, this app is so engaging! I don't have the analytical words that I need handy in my brain right now, but suffice it to say that it's the first app I've ever found where the teaching style suits my learning style, AND it works well with my ADHD brain! So far, I absolutely love it.",5
"On my S24+ the apps GUI is quite buggy, if you press a menu item 2 times quite fast the app will freeze and a restart is required. If you press a practise or lesson a bit too fast it will initiate the same lesson or practise again after you've finished it. These small kind of stutters make the app feel very janky.",2
"Course material are a BIG MESS! Stay away from their subscription plan because you are going to be disappointed! Updates are being made frequently which in itself would be a good thing, but certainly not when some of the course material is being removed completely and not being replaced! Subscription is a high annual fee, the least that a paying customer should expect in these kind of services is that their progress would be saved and always revisable, well it's not!!",1
It just keeps on getting worse and worse with each update. Restrictive Ui. Removed offline mode. Removed astrophysics and quantum physics courses. Pointless leagues system (literally imposible to go back down and I can't even tell if there's other people on the leaderboard or not). Removed search bar (WHY?). Weirdly named courses and classes so it's hard to find that topic by it's actual name. Email responses are vague and unclear. Unclear change logs. Broken courses (Electricity one ends abrupt,2
"Constant updates and changes in the courses destroy the sence off achievement and accomplishment. Also your saying that you are trying to improve course material but in fact I experience the complete opposite of that! When I learned something I want to be able to revise what I've learned, tell me how can I do that when you keep removing content and replacing it for basically the same content, only massively simplified and expect us to go do the whole thing all over again!",1
"Its now a positive review, originally it was negative. I like the app a lot, but the company has a strange policy of constantly removing stuff and not replacing it for a while, so you buy subscription and see the thing you wanted getting removed with no alert. They thankfully added back in the course that I wanted, but that took a while.",4
"Great app! It helped me in understanding fundamental math which is a miracle since as my entire life nobody was able to teach me math in a way i could understand it. The reason i gave it 4 stars is you have limited lessons for free and have to pay for it if you wish to continue. This was a downer for me as it would so much better what duolingo did, as they let you use the app without subscription but you have limited lifes per day and there are minimal ads that don't get too annoying.",4
"Do not use their trial. They will charge you and won't refund. Last year, I used the free trial and then I unsubscribed. But Brilliant had started charging me annually without me realising and without ever sending me a receipt of the payment. I found out when I realized they charged me this month for the second year and I asked for a refund. They would not refund me, even for this year although I have never used their service.",1
"I feel like I am learning a lot less than I could. Some exercises are clearly fillers, and it really takes me out of it. Especially when you think they are done, and the next exercise is literally the same... Then you jump to level two... same levels...",2
"I have struggled for years with certain concepts, Algebra, Logic Puzzles, this App makes it seem so simple. It keeps testing and reinforcing your understanding and if you ever fall down or don't understand the answer there is a button to press to give you an explanation of why it went wrong.",5
"I've been using it on PC thinking ""This would work great on mobile devices."" Without a doubt the most fun I've had on a mobile app, including the biggest mobile games. I do wish you could get a discount on at least one month, three months or a six months' subscription though. Or at least not have to pay for the yearly subscription in a clump sum.",5
"After the new sorting and labeling of the courses, it's much more confusing to pick a particular math chapter as I don't know Which comes first, why can't you sort and structure courses like in the real world, that it's more clear. I don't think your path feature is that helping coz I want to know which part of the math I'm currently learning like and what's next eh: prealgebra, algebra | , algebra || and so on. Math is the only reason I purchased this. I don't think it's valid anymore.",3
"I have some trauma related to studying, and lots of times can't concentrate without regressing to the unhealthy headspace I used to be in when studying. Due to this, I find myself avoiding studies, but in this economy? That has repurcussions unfortunately haha. But this app is interactive and teaches lessons from SCRATCH, which is exactly what I need! It's not like I'm studying a textbook, but I'm still learning everything I need to. Much respect and love to everyone involved in its making <3",5
"Edit: (Dec. 07, 24) I was completely satisfied with this app until my annual subscription was auto-renewed at full price at the same time they had a Black Friday deal on for 30% off. When I reached out to them, they said they would not honour the deal. Apparently money means more to them than client satisfaction. I suggest cancelling your auto-renew as soon as you pay so you too don't miss out on future deals. Integrity in business is important Brilliant. Do better.",2
"This was what I was searching for and loved this app the most but when I realised it's not free and have limited things to do without paying,this was most upsetting.Even if they had ads to earn from it was fine but if want to keep it ad free and earn from premium,so most of the users would be just upset as me.Every thing in this app is perfect,animations,question... 5/5 if they had it free questions without premium",2
"I signed up for a 1 week trial. At the end of the trial period it automatically billed for a full year membership, not monthly. If the app isn't going to prompt asking how you'd like to renew membership, it shouldn't automatically be going to the full year",1
"Absolutely amazing! It fits my style so much. It teaches so well. I added it to my daily schedule. It is definitely better than all real-life solving math apps I've seen! I just wish some more exercices were free. Still, thanks for this!😊",5
I was looking for a way to upgrade my thoughts 🤔💭 on coding 👨🏾‍💻 and when I found out that Brilliant was doing a FREE 30 - DAY TRIAL I just had to try it ( I can pay for it but I love free stuff 😜). *I was also have been seeing way too much ads of this when watching YouTube so why not just try it I guess😅*,5
"There is a canyon of death between simple vectors multiplication and gaussian elimination of matrixes, but one goes after another. Linear algebra turned into the Frankenstein monster. You should pick the canaries and train on them. Latest app version high math lessons are awfully complex and unengaging.",2
"Three stars are for the app and not for Brilliant. This app is leggy, duplicate lessons and practice popups. Pour rendering of the content as well as poor visibility of the content in some conditions. Also no dark theme in 2025, what are we doing?",3
"Thiis app claims to make you smarter but I'm pretty sure I lost a couple braincells having to sit through all of ads trying to get me to spend money in the app with their subscription plans. Seriously, an ad after every lesson that takes less than a minute to complete is a bit too much.",1
"This app is a life changer I dropped our of grade 7 (Don't worry I'm only 13 so chill I will enroll when it's summer) this app is awesome it helped me relearn some stuff I almost forgot, still using the free lessons tho ha thanks again! Hey me again, I can't extent my streak because I have to buy the premium. Can you decrease the price by 10 euros instead? That'd be a huge deal for me thanks again.",5
Best App to imagine mathematics in easy way . It is the best app for critical thinking problem and with enhancing skills . This app is better than scrolling on reels and shorts . ✅ I use this app after studying and in leisure time .✅ Thank your team for this app . ❤️ In my suggestion can you add some offline features to this app . Thank you for your feedback! I suggest using Google Ads to recover app expenses and reduce subscription costs. This will promote free education for all . 📈,5
it's ok. I wish I could skip ahead of lessons. I selected probability but it's teaching me about gears. and it's so much about gears. I really need to do better in probability and I feel like I am not going to actually get there but be stuck on gears.,2
"Started out enjoying the app, but decided to pause it because I lost interest. I paid for the year, but now can't get into the app. Emailed développer twice, no response. Forgot password option doesn't work.",2
I have wanted to find a way to learn about science and maths in areas i never studied. This is brilliant and engaging. Bite sized interactive learning with really regular feedback loops - love it.,5
Super fun and educational. Would recommend it to anyone. The Interface is organized and I love the idea of leagues. I feel like I've learned topics 10x faster in Brilliant than in school.,5
I got through the first 8 exercises faster then their ad for the premium account played for. And after 8 exercises you can't do any more unless you pay. What an almost complete garbage app.,2
"This is just a Duolingo rip-off that tries to make coding a fun game. Coding is not a game. It's boring and annoying. By making it into a game, the lessons aren't really teaching anything. Maybe the math and science sections are better, but I got the app for programming.",2
"Excellent Learning App, Even Without Premium Brilliant is an amazing app for anyone interested in learning and problem-solving. Even without using the premium features, I can tell this app is thoughtfully designed with quality content. The free lessons are engaging and well-structured, making it easy to understand challenging concepts in math, science, and more. I can only imagine how much more valuable the premium content must be!.",5
"It's a great app , especially for someone like me who is having problems learning maths and physics because of language barriers and bad teachers, . Still broke to buy premium though 🥲",5
"Number of courses in maths are not doing justice to the content being covered. They have too many courses for elementary basic math but as we move to calculus side they are just giving up on courses. They must realise that we pay such a high price to learn more complex things like Calculus, Linear Algebra etc. in easier way. Also, they remove the existing important courses silently w/o informing the users (i.e they removed Quantitative Finance course). Please improve.",2
"Good learning app but when you reach a certain point in a course, you have to purchase a plan in order to continue. Also, constantly bombarded with ad to purchase the full app so have deleted",2
This app is so great. I used a free trial and this was the most educational month I've had in a while. They break the lessons down so well. With that being said I am blown away with how expensive it would be to keep using it. I can't explain how sad I am that this is over :/,4
"Fantastic tool for anyone interested in enhancing their understanding of math, science, and computer science using interactive, hands-on learning. The design, user experience, and approach to problem-solving make a great choice for those who enjoy learning actively rather than passively consuming content.",5
Beware & Disappointing. Do not install this app until you're ready to use it on day 1. The developer kindly offers trying 7 days premium for free but does not disclose that you have 48 hours to accept it until it's too late. There should be an option to choose when to start the free trial. Will not have time to start using it until Thanksgiving holiday. Now I'll lose that free trial offer. We'll see if app gets a better rating at some point. The marketing got to me which is why I downloaded now.,2
I love the app teaches a lot i was thinking if i should buy premium and i made a decision that i will and then price went up by like 200% its more than my monthly bus ticket i didnt buy premium pls think about adjusting the price to each countries economy but overall thats the best app j ever had on my phone,4
"Probably the only completely valid and worth it Ad you would find on youtube that is echoed multiple times across so many different channels.Buying via play store gives you an even better discount.I have been learning for a month now and this is one of the best 4,000 rs i ever invested in something.Everything is built so well and captivatingly,like a detective explaining who was the murderer in the final play,it takes you from baby steps to ""OH! THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT!"". PS:Request for dark mode.",5
"They remove courses without providing adequate alternatives. Differential Equations, now even multivatiable calculus and vector calc were axed, which are really important. It has been a while and now I checked back and instead of finding alternatives to courses that have been removed a while ago, I find even more missing. Data Analysis is a joke, its so easy. I am done, which is sad as the interactive nature had educational value, but not the content direction.",1
The interactive part is amazing. Makes learning very fun The examples are interesting and problems make you think. My only suggestion is to add dark theme.,5
"I love this app! It's a great way to learn and pass the time. If you're looking for hands on learning then this is for you. The only thing wrong I would say is that it sucks you have to pay for this. It says it's free, but it only gives you a preview into the lessons, and then you have to pay to go further. If you have the money and you want to learn more, then I recommend this for you!",4
"I unsubscribed the same week I installed the app. With a confirmation that the subscription was canceled. Then weeks later charged for an annual subscription. I have a screen recording of the confirmation that the subscription will be canceled. When lodging a support request, the service is only then canceled and a refund is given. I guarantee multiple users have their funds unlawfully stolen and they do no follow up or report this deeply unethical behavior. You have been reported.",1
The creators found a way to turn education into a video game. Earn XP (experience points) to rank up on leaderboards all while learning. It is an addictive form of education,5
Writing this review on my first 29th streak day! (i.e. using the app for 29 days straight) Went through and completed 8 courses by now. For users: This app has no enemies! This is The Best academic investment I made so far. Price?Reasonable. Content? Interactive. Learning Experience? Amazing. Science class have never been this engaging. For Brilliant Team: Thanks a lot for making science this much graspable! May be you can work on incorporating courses like Chemistry and Biology in the future.,5
"I am enjoying immensely this method of improving my life skills. As I am 81 years of age this refreshing of mu previous studies is immensely beneficial to my cognitive health. I intend putting this at the top of my daily activity Lists. As a retired person, I spend all my time working on my health and fitness. As the age old saying goes use it or lose it. What's not to like about looking after yourself.",5
"Loving Brilliant so far. I'm polishing up my maths later in life, and I'm finding the way that algebra is taught to be the best I've come across. The exercises really get you to think and understand what you are doing - rather than mindlessly learning rules as I did in the past.",5
The app ads a fun experience to learning math related subjects. And that's coming from someone who hates math class!!! I just wish there was another plan that isn't a full year...... ( I recommend the computer science courses for video games fans ),5
"Elevates learning to new heights! This app not only transforms complex concepts into accessible lessons but also engages users with an intuitive, highly interactive design. Highly recommend it for anyone eager to refine their skills and excel in their studies. I express my profound gratitude to anyone involved in this BRILLIANT idea. PROVIDING OPEN ACCESS FOR ALL, FREE OF CHARGE, WOULD BE IMMENSELY ADVANTAGEOUS. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS IDEA SINCE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT CAN'T AFFORD.",5
"I absolutely adore this app, its exactly what I've been looking for. I really recommend it to everyone. I do however wish there was a dark mode because the white is whiting, and also I really hope they add a way to like maybe somewhat sort? your courses and also maybe discard some. I, rn, have a lot of courses opened bcz I just wanted to see what they're like, I don't however plan on focusing on them as of now so they kinda annoy me (I'm not sure how to explain, maybe it's just a me problem)",4
Had a negative experience on a Samsung S9 and had to use my laptop to use Brilliant. Recently got a Google pixel 9 pro and it works perfectly. The ease with which you can learn daunting topics makes this a worthwhile app to pay for. Highly recommend.,5
"It's a great learning app I'll recommend everyone whoever have purchasing power of such apps. I hate it's freemiun model, it just provide review of each course. Duolingo is following the same freemiun model but they allow people to learn but wth is this. Although it's great but please consider my request too.",1
We tried this app for my kid for 1 day but he didn't find it interesting enough. I forgot to cancel the subscription and found out that I was charged for full year premium plan. I asked immediately to cancel and get refund. We didn't use the service at all. The company replied that it's not in their policy to give refund for customer who made a mistake. That's suck... poor customer service. You should charge for value and not by taking advantage of ppl mistake.,1
It is amusing and challengy. Sometimes it is a bit slow when switching from the end of an exercise to the following one and I also met once a bug that made it necessary the app reboot. But it is good anyway to me.,4
"Honestly I have used brilliant for free but once I subscribed to the premium plan the courses are no longer opening I always get this message ""THIS IS TAKING LONGER THAN USUAL"" back to course. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app same things. Sucks",1
"Currently using free version, will update when / if I get premium So far, the app is great. It is really easy to understand what is writen and if you dont understand the answer, it will explain it for you, for free. Sometumes the app can be a little slow, maybe thats just me, but closing and opening the app fixes it.",5
"I appreciate this app a lot, and those who work on the encouraging notifications you're really brilliant guys!!, when I saw that notification that tells me ""congratulations! You didn't practice for 30 days keep going!"" I felt bad really and I went back!",5
"Quit giving me logic for quick practice, I cannot figure out for the life of me how to chance it, I completed the modules, despite not enjoying it, and have started and finished many other categories, but every time I get on and do the quick practice, I get logic.",2
"Great, multi devices way to learn various stem concepts. This one engaged me to technology sector the most from all. I would definitely like to get your style course from business/management side. Good luck. Keep this good work going 👍 🤞",5
"One of the best apps in the world making the world a better place. The lessons are designed so well that makes you keep on grinding and coming back. A gem to the world. If you have a kid who's interested in STEM, this is a must have app. Btw, subscription is totally worth it",5
I think the only way this could be better is to offer marketing. I love this app. I have ADHD and traditional learning is a challenge. These bite sized lessons are so much easier.,4
Where have all the courses gone. When I go to the home page I can't browse courses like I used to. Is this a bug or deliberate programming? Really need to get back to the maths since I am going back to college soon and was using the app to brush up on some fundementals. Other than this I think the app is great! Wonderful! Fantastic! (Notice I avoided saying brilliant),4
"Hello Brilliant team, I enjoyed the app for 2-3 days that it worked on my Pixel 6. I have installed it because of an YouTube add and quite liked it but it started to crush (back to desktop) every time I opened it. Now I've been charged for a whole year and I'm not happy at all because I couldn't have cancelled the subscription even if I tried because it only loads the bottom menu/navigation and then crashes without any message. Please help. Thank you",1
"App itself is great. Provides entertaining and accessible way to learn. Nonetheless yearly payment is a thing that keeps me off the subscription. As previous folks said - for people outside ""strong currencies countries"" it's a lot of money to spend at once. If only there was monthly payment option available I'd buy it straightaway.",4
I can't move these stars up. I'm probably being generous. User experience is poor. And when you purchase a subscription almost a year ago and it doesn't improve it's a bit pathetic. This review isn't about content. Play reviews are about app experience. With an interrupting loading screen to load near static content it's just frustrating. Furthermore knowing how data dense content is why is there no download feature. 2 huge misses! Seriously what is the UI/UX team doing last 2 months?,2
"Great So Far. I'm giving it a go as a mid fifties dad, I have really enjoyed switching the lights back on and getting the gears grinding again. There's lots of options for courses, It will be great if they keep adding to the subjects and adding more options. I'll come back and give it a five out of five once I have delved a little deeper. You have to be able to cope with getting things incorrect/wrong, feeling the failure (it hurts!) and then expanding your thinking to learn and understand. 👍",4
"On 1 January I purchased a group subscription for 3 people for 12 months: myself, my daughter and my friend's son, Jake (for his birthday) .I succeeded in linking my daughter but now can't find how to link the third user. I feel bad for not having been able to give Jake his birthday present.I don't see any instructions in the help page. Support is too busy to help. I regret my purchase.",1
"I firstly wanted go say, Im not paid, nor sponsored. Im 23 with Autism and ADHD and in high school I took two algebra 1 classes and never understood a thing. I also failed Geometry and school made me hate math but after only being on here for 5 days, This is the best way Ive been able to actually understand Algebra and Im excited to learn more about coding and Python once I finish Math 1.1. I wish schools used this app",5
"Looked interesting, but has an auto renew price plan which you must agree to before signing up. These disproportionately negatively impact neurodivergent people, therefore they are discriminatory. I'd be happy to try for a shorter period without signing up for an auto renew. Companies always claim these things are easy to cancel. They never are.",1
"Wanted to do the 7 days trial, but after I enter my credit card details it still not showing the premium content. I tried to redo it and it says already subscribed. So at the end I couldn't try the app.",1
"I've been using this app for over a month twice a day, and now it's getting glitchy and unusable, and crashes sometimes. Maybe it's my phone, but I dont understand why it's putting a strain on my phone. I've already bought an annual subscription which is annoying. I'd love to use this app as it's a great idea and I've been spending an hour or more a day focused studying.",3
"Just missed the subscription cancellation deadline, and they refused to offer a refund. Sure, it's technically my fault, but I still find it shady, and I won't use their service ever again.",1
Awesome app!! Very interactive and interesting app. One suggestion is to add an option to make courses available offline. So that one can download content when internet is available and then learn even when there is no internet. I couldn't use the app when I was traveling since I had an unstable internet and wished this option was available.,5
"I signed up just today but the first two coding exercises were totally broken (it won't let me do anything, like clicking on the streets to mark them, or sliding the blocks in the exercise after.). I then tried force closing the app and restarting it. It didn't even load the lessons after. A very bad first experience with the app.",1
"This app , ever since I installed it I have never been able to participate in a lesson , it always shows ""this is taking longer than usual"" for like 10minutes without loading it finally and sometimes the app just quits by itself pls fix this",1
Changing the terms of service and force you to agree with them if you continue to use their services. This mentality has to be put to a stop. I agreed to the terms when I signed up I did not agree for you to change them after the fact. I'm changing my terms and want a full refund.,1
"The lessons are very easy to understand. I used it to learn programming, and it was a great experience. Except for the fact that the app freezes a lot, I can still easily give it a five-star rating.",5
"App seems cool, but there's too many ads. Sometimes is more time in ads than in studying. Also, they will spam your inbox.",1
"Brilliant apps are trully brilliant! but it's unfortunate that there aren't available languange in my country yet (Indonesia). also the price are sadly unafordable in my country, i hope there will be some policy to solve that.",3
I've been subscribing for years. The original ethos was learning by trying which I thoroughly agree with. But the league feature is now so all consuming that it now discourages me from starting new courses. I don't really understand their motivation unless they are monetizing the data for some reason. Do they need to do this?,2
"I like the challenging Logic puzzles. It literally made me perform better at my work. Overall, I like how the challenges increase when you keep doing them. It doesn't spoonfeed you with all info which is a good thing. Sometimes, the explanations are not clear, maybe the team can work on it.",5
Crashes often and I can't refund for my yearly subscription. It's annoying to use such a glichy improper service my money got wasted for the yearly subscription. Hope they could help me initiate refund.,2
"I love the app and the way it is veey interactive, sadly, I am a minor and I have no way of paying for premium and the basic plan is too small for me. I would pay premium if I had a way to do it.",5
"Four stars for the app itself. -2 stars for predatory payment scheme. -2 stars for app started to lag like crazy after I subscribed. We are talking 4 second delays, unresponsiveness, scrolling is a nightmare. If I hadn't paid for it a moment ago, I would have just uninstalled it. I've cancelled the subscription.",1
Great app! I enjoy the micro learning bursts or taking the time to really focus on something. It would be great for students or just for fun.,5
Terrible as many other apps that do not inform you that you have to always provide the credit card data to do a trial test of a few days. So you lose your time in giving all your contact details for nothing.,1
Has a persistent bug where lessons get stuck loading. Very frustrating for an otherwise great app to be held back like this.,3
"Good app if you can afford it; subscription is overpriced and free version is incredibly restrictive, giving you access to basically nothing. YouTube teaches you all this information for free",2
"Really awesome alternative to mindless scrolling on social media apps! Sometimes a few animations cause the app to crash, but mostly pretty awesome experience!",4
"Brilliant is an app that is helping me in the process of learning math. It's been really cool to solve the problems and to get the classes. I'm addicted to the brilliant methodology.It's helping me a lot to focus on and practice everyday math.I hope in the future.I can use brilliant to learn Computer science as well.Science and the other stuff. It's worth the price and I really recommend you if you want to improve your math skills. If you want to do something productive, brilliant the key.",5
"This app is very interactive and cool, and as for me, a weaker student in particular subjects has really helped me.",5
Fairly Easy to use even on the Bus but resuming a lesson does not dive you in exactly where you left off and can be slow depending on conditions,5
"Good when it works but I've found it a little glitchy. It's also very expensive, I expected a more stable platform for the money.",3
They give you the impression that is free like khan but is only a bit of it. The rest has this very expensive subscription. Do not recommend.,1
"fantastic app, really make me feel seen as a visual thinker next to my standard education as a child which was just remembering everything and executing from memory. but it's way to expensive for my wallet",5
It's an experience that comes with it's own motivation. I always look forward to practicing maths because of how the lessons and practice are easy to understand.,5
Excellent and convenient. Easy to take lessons and great explanation of complex concepts. Incentivizes you to do better.,5
"Great content, but the Android app has been buggy and even freezing as times. Believe they were recently looking for an android dev, so hoping these issues get ironed out",3
"Hey, while i was just on Brilliant, i noticed something..... Why does it look so similar to Duolingo? Im a bit skeptical.... Anyway, great app! I give it 5 stars",5
"Veritasium sent me here 😁 I resist subscriptions, would much rather buy outright. But I made an exception for Brilliant because it is what it says it is. I'm about to tumble into my 70's. Still sharp and still have a career as a s/w dev. But there is some decline at least wrt fluid intelligence. So I was doing stuff like Guardian cryptics, spider, killer sudoku etc. Brilliant gives me as much entertainment and mental exercise, but allows that to be more targeted. Better use of my time.",5
"I failed high school maths miserably and thought I'd never figure it out. After a teacher recommended this app to me, I now think maths is fun! I especially enjoy learning why and how an equation works, which is what this app has nailed 👌",5
"I like the part when a questions are explained, but it would be better if you could also leave us intrigued so as to motivate us to look problems from different points of view. Thank you for making brilliant it helps a lot, but in order to make it accessible to everyone make it a little cheaper please.",5
"Great for learning and keeping things sharp. Would like some more advanced versions of the courses, but it's a small gripe, I love this app.",4
DIDN'T WARN UPFRONT THAT THEY WOULD CUT OFF MY ACCESS AFTER A COUPLE DAYS IF I DIDN'T PAY ~20-100 EUROS. I completed menial tasks about things I already knew only to get cut off with 0 warning. The content was also not quite as interactive as I expected.,1
"I am changing this review because of the excellent customer service I received. I initially was unhappy with how this app performed. It did not work properly on my device, and additionally, I misunderstood the payment plan. However, the people at Brilliant were professional and helped me resolve my situation. I am very happy with how it turned out in the long run.",4
I really like the app. Just been some freezing issues on both phone and tablet. Other than that the app is fun.,3
Love this app. Has been strengthening my Math thinking skills with this app. Would definitely recommend to download. I hope more lessons esp on data analysis will be added.,5
Used the free trial with the intent to continue monthly. It auto renews to an annual subscription. Support told me correcting that and switching to a standard plan is against policy. The app is fine but there are more affordable services out there which achieve the same thing without resorting to shady business practices.,1
"Brilliant is an interactive app for both users young and old that helps encourage and adapt your brilliant soul( intelligence) I recommend Brilliant for your future success in academics and just plain fun with this interactive activities and it's community. Brilliant believes in everyone, no matter young or old brilliant believes "" you're brilliant with Brilliant""",5
It was very great! This is like Duolingo for stem instead of linguistics with how it is structured!,5
Love the app and everything it has to offer. Only problem is it crashes once every few times I open it.,4
"Current update makes the app unusable. Constantly hit with ""unable to open lesson"" or just getting white screened. There are questions that are very vague with little to no info. When you open the explanation it doesn't always list all of the options for choice options. UI isn't the best",2
"App is great, works slow on older phone, the height percentage for content vs frame could be greater so it would be easier to use on small res screens.",4
Even the free stuff is great. I do wish there was a monthly option for premium though. I'd buy it if you had a monthly option.,5
"After buying premium the difficulty of lessons degrades immensely, I bought premium believing I'd get harder questions, please add harder questions in maths science and logic. I love the app and it is very great",3
"I love the application, but currently I'm facing an issue where application crashes after I'm done with one practice session. And sometimes the application doesn't start",4
"This app is just heaven for learning anything,i love that it's not blocked by a paywall like most apps of this quality,heck this app's quality exeeds most of those that are behind a paywall. 100% advise you to download this",5
Very high quality presentation of material. I hope with time number of courses increases.,5
"I have just started and I love the app. Programme is made in a very digestible format. Advanced math (even though I had all of the subjects at school) provides not just formulae yo learn and apply, but actual understanding of concepts. Love it. So sad, I did have that kind of education at school",5
"Learn by paying a lot of Money 👌... Accidentally subscribed to yearly plan, perhaps it was my fault for not cancelling the plan after trial period. But they refuse to refund and change to monthly plan, so whats the point of having refund option? I still want to use but, but im not sure i can consistently use it, so perhaps monthly is way to go. Poor customer service, wont be using it again 👎",1
"1 star from me due to the auto renew policy, never really used this and forgot about it and got auto charged £100 for it, if you use this or not dont forget to unregister it , as Brilliants policy is none re-fundable apparently, so now stuck with it and don't use it, worth a 1 star I think for that reason alone",1
"After performing 2 problems I cannot find a way to advance. Also, I don't pay for features or advancements so I'm not sure I'll keep this. Great concept if it were 100% free and worked. I'll keep trying for a few days bc I really want to like it.",1
I want to thank you this app for created such a good learning way for kinesthetic learner like me. I've never been happy learning in class but with this I'm happy on my own and there are such pictures and problems for me to solve on hand which is fun not boring. Thank you.,5
Really like the interface and app design approach But price is quite high for a student won't mind having ads but a subscribtion for more than ₹1000/month is kinda risky and expensive.,4
"Used it for 1 month, seems useless. Additionally, they are a company that makes it difficult to cancel the subscription.",1
"Just a week in and I am enjoying the math I'm going through. It's simple, but it's working my brain muscle. Which is in sore need!",5
I've had a very positive experience with brilliant even tho I am very inconsistent in using it my only complaint is that they contact you so much if you leave there notifications enabled,5
"At first I will love 😙 to thanks brilliant team. For giving us this exiting content for learning. It's so easy that I will love to invest more on it. , I know the pricing are so cheap but.... I live in Bangladesh where the price are slightly higher than other. I mean if I was in America I can easily afford it but I live in Bangladesh where the USD values are so high. So I hope that the price will be slightly different in country like Bangladesh",5
Yet another forced subscription free trial model. Yes we know we can cancel and it's just a coincidence that you haven't implemented a free trial which forgetting about earns you money. Scummy behaviour now the standard. 👎,1
"I'm having a lot of fun with these, good lessons. 3 stars for the irony I'm experiencing right now learning how to code in an app that has so many bugs.",3
"Nothing much to say except it does exactly what they claim it does! Seamless movement, and most importantly, they explain!! :') I promise to upgrade to premium once I can afford it 🙏🏻 thank you guys 😊",5
I wish I never used this because it's really fun and interesting but it is INSANELY expensive. I am not paying $25 a month to pat myself on the back for being smart no matter how much I enjoy it.,3
"The app is perfect, but I'm here to learn for free, and there are a lot of problems with learning for free, such as a limited lesson, which for me suck but I love this app ❤️",4
It's really great to be able to learn a topic in 10 minute blocks. Great interactive puzzles,5
"The title of the app says it all, as the most sophisticated learning app that also keeps it simple to comprehend and very rewarding!",5
"I absolutely love it, I can not only understand but feel math. And it gives me horizontal connections between different topics. I'd wish I had this app when I was in school",5
"I commute to work by train every day, but the content is not available offline. I’ve reached out to customer service twice, and they informed me that this feature won’t be available anytime soon due to costly development. Considering how expensive the yearly subscription already is, it’s disappointing that such a basic feature isn’t supported. Modern apps should prioritize customer needs. This will be the last time I purchase a yearly subscription from brilliant.",3
Makes it very easy and comfortable to go through each subject.Long story short it makes learning pleasant.Thanks,5
"I just started using the app last week and I'm still getting to know it but I'm giving it a 1 star review because it keeps suggesting that a write a ticket on a bug report when I didn't ask for one and I'm tired of it!!!!. Please do something about it so that I won't be forced to delete the app. Also, it takes a really long time for the app to load whenever I open it which is also annoying",1
"Where is there price for premium after my trial ends? I signed up for the trial of Brilliant Premium after seeing a sponsorship in a YouTube channel I watch regularly. I received a warning that my trial was ending soon - thanks, that's good service. However... unsure whether I would continue as my use of the app has dropped off, I tried to find the price for continuing the premium subscription, and after bouncing round several links that only wanted to advertise features, gave up. UNACCEPTABLE.",1
Love brilliant. Duolingo and Brilliant are two apps which I use on a daily basis for learning. Appreciate all the efforts put into making this wonderful app. I also wished brilliant also had a widget similar to Duolingo for Android. This helps in motivation to keep the streak going as I constantly see it on my screen.,5
"Brilliant is exceptional, it has a simple way of teaching things (using text as well as visual) and also a good UI in Android as well as Web and their pricing plans are also good. New courses are also being added. Overall excellent 10/10.",5
"It's been a good run, 10ish days... now the app is stuck on loading screen when I try to open it... streak will prpbably end and not sure how to stop the app from charging me. Hopefully it'll figure itself out soon. Restarting the phone doesn't work...",1
I make games in my free time and I often get stuck on developing simple math related features. Brilliant helps me approach difficult problems by teaching me the fundamentals that I missed during high school. I'm 33 and I can finally say I love math.,5
"I am enjoying this app so much, they explain everything better than any other teacher or course I've ever taken. Love all the different courses and subjects and how you can go from fundamentals to more advanced problems.",5
"Rant warning ‼️⚠️: I suggested this app to my 10 year old daughter. I have her profile on family link so I approve apps for her. I don't have her for this part of the summer. Just wanted her to start academics so that she isn't behind when school starts. Review and not forget everything from the summer break. Tell me why the parent must login after she installs it. Maybe I'm missing something here, this is an academic app right? Any other app, she can just open and play. 🙅Parent sign in 🚫",1
"It's like the tutor or teacher I always wanted to help me to stimulate my mind and learn. Thank you Brilliant to let me enjoy that experience in the digital form. It can cost me to pay attention to things, but you made more easy and enjoyable. Greetings from Peru.",5
Impressive learning material with Brilliant. I like the broad range of subjects covered. I also would like to see more added like law and its variations. Overall a great app to add for learning at your fingertips.,5
First time I come here to write a review of an App on my own initiative and not because I was prompted. Brilliant is the best App on my phone. That’s it. It's worth the money. I purchased it also for my 12yo kid. You want your kid to play with this instead of social media. Give them real prizes when they achieve milestones. Cheers to the devs.,5
It's a great a app because in every lesson it explains it to you in simple terms and for every wrong or correct answer you can ask why.,5
"It's a amazing app however, I think you should make it so if someone gets a certain number of questions wrong it restarts the section (with different questions); until the understand and the more they fail you should make the explanations more and more simple.",5
This app is fun and entertaining and you can really easily learn something new by just spending 15 minutes a day. I've got no problem with it so far.,5
this is the best app to learn programming because you can simulate how the code works! This saves me time to understand how to code!!,5
Great app and a great visual way to learn. Highly recommend for visual learners.,5
"Capitalism killed brilliant. I am nostalgic of the era of users generated exercises and practices. Many great courses disappeared for no reason (biology, solar, computer memory, complex numbers...). The wiki was such a tremendous resource and now It’s almost inaccessible. The old interface is much better and less flashy. Possibility of restarting a course still not implemented! According to their A/B tests they are doing the best for their business but for us, passionate people it is a disaster.",1
"Easy, step by step learning. I really enjoy having bite sized options for programming",5
Quick bite-sized information that improves your abilities in whatever subject you are studying.,5
"Currently on the free trial, Brilliant is amazing. I'm trying to relearn math that had been long forgotten and it is rushing back to me. I am very grateful towards Brilliant.",5
"Dont need to tell anything, go watch a quality science documentary or content and you will see it is sponsored by Brilliant. This is not a regular rubbish app of this digital rubbish world. This is beyond the traditional sense of applications or your worthless phone. It is up to you to use the full potential of this portal.",5
"I am on streak 28, been using it daily since I bought it. I am learning a ton about all the things I had forgotten and also about topics that always peeked my interest but always seemed out of reach. I recommend it 100%",5
"Good app terrible pricing, the only reason I can think of why they don't offer monthly subscription is that they themselves don't believe in their product.",1
I cant believe all this is free. It's so fun and effective to learn by interactive problems and games. thank you,5
"Pretty good, however a tiny expensive for the amount of content they currently have. As they update and add more and more content every month the value of it would definitely match its current price.",5
"I am impressed! It is essentially the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) version of Duolingo. The coding course is especially fun. Straightforward explanations of important concepts. Keeps you sharp. You won't forget the valuable knowledge you learnt in highschool. Just make sure you are literate AKA for ages 12 and up unless ur a smarty 🤓. Oh and I like the sound effects and that simplistic green character.",5
"To be honest, I was expecting to find a parameter to change language but it doesn't exist,when I did the section of data filtering it feels like you are reading a book even some easy and simple definition are made hard in the text , also I suggest for you to use Ai to make it easier for people to interact and make less test and more examples... Thank you for understanding",2
"It has been a wonderful experience with Brilliant. My mindset is open to new possibilities and perspectives of life, because now I realize that is not about memorize formulas or procedures, but it is a way to overcome challenges focusing on the process (organization, going step by step) and about all the confidence in myself. The lesson is: it does not matter how difficult a problem is in life, just go ahead, acting with confidence, that on the way the solution will be found. Thanks.",5
"Content is OK (based on two week free trial), but the payment part is very shady. Unlike all subscription services that I am using and plan to use again in the future, Brilliant shows the one ""price"" (15.75€ per month) of Premium on the purchase page but then they tried to charge me 20€ because the the price they are showing doesn't include taxes?! I was already on the fence based on how hard they are overcharging you for monthly subscription as opposed to a yearly; so this was the final straw",3
"TLDR, I had high hopes, and they were really not met. Advertised to be very interactive, but it is just a ton of reading. Questions worded in double and triple negatives for no reason other than making them harder without elevating the actual question. Which is boring. And nowhere near the amount of courses/topics advertising lead me to believe there was.",2
Crashes way too much and the rate you learn stuff is way too fast.,1
"Third lesson I do, introduction to graphes in maths course. There is an equation and value of X, I have to find Y on a graph, I do it exactly as shown in explanation, but somehow it's still incorrect.",1
"Incredible design. Makes learning the toughest concepts fun, and therefore easy. If I had this app in my school years it would have changed my life. Totally worth the subscription.",5
"Examples are very easy to understand and follow. Seeing this visually really helps me learn and understand the whole concept, which I've struggled with in the past.",5
"Brilliant is a very well-thought-out application well designed for different subjects and categories to learn, refresh, and sharpen your skills on. Nice work brilliant awesome app :-)",5
"It's free until you do about 10 lessons and if you want to carry on using it you need to pay an outrageous amount of money. Better of using Khan Academy it's better. Please see this: I have an idea that would have this app better. Give the user an option, get the full course to 3 of the lessons or get the first course to all of them. Please respond 🙏 because I think your format is really user friendly to people who might struggle with learning and staying focused.",2
"This app is a lot like Duolingo, but with math. Brilliant is really great of you want to start learning computer science. It's amazing, and that's all I can say.",5
"I only asked for a trial and never confirmed the renewal of the paid subscription. However, Brilliant auto-renewed my subscription and they tried to charge my card! I asked to cancel my subscription, but they tried to charge me again. I deleted my account and they are still trying to charge! EDIT: I contacted the support team and my issue is resolved. Rating is updated.",4
"Nice idea but I played once and you've bugged me for prescriptions twice in game and once via email. Not interested, uninstalled.",2
"Indeed brilliant, easily and interactively explained, step by step, very carefully laid out...",5
I was pleasantly surprised how useful and fun it was for me to pick up learning computer science and refresh my math and science. Please add more topics in relation to AI and Quantum to help layman build future skills.,5
"The free preview is too short, and the premium subscription is too expensive. Great courses, though.",3
Brilliant is a fantastic way to learn. My first lesson answered a question I had for years - why is squaring so prevalent in math?,5
"Very easy to understand and learn, if you mess something up it explains it to you.",5
"nice learning app. Definitely advise using. they even show you why your answers were wrong, while still making the following questions challenging.",5
Nice interface and content but it's too expensive and I already have tens of subscriptions for more useful apps :(,3
The instructions are clear and the lessons nicely build on one another. Love it!,5
"This app sucks so much the problems at the ""beginner level"" are way too hard is there anyone who achieved results using this app? No. It sucks.",1
"I'm using this app to learn how to code. And I am loving so far. Not all exercises are exact or precisely explained, but it helps when learning skills 👍🏻❤️🙂",5
"This is my second week on this, and I am already addicted. Nice way for reviewing college time subject as well as getting in touch with new hot topics",5
"Great app but I got charged for a month I was meant to cancel, the app simply didn't let me! It wouldn't go through",1
It's literally brilliant. Making learning addictive and so much better for my mental health than doom scrolling.,5
Wonderful app. Wish there was more availability to those who wish to stay on a free platform.,4
Been using it every day. Love the challenges and learning a lot!,5
I have found it so useful in learning the basics again. Its very easy to use and inspiring,5
Great activities to put your mind to different thinking and reasoning activities - nicely scaled upwards as you improve.,4
A great learning experience that takes complex topics and breaks them down into bite sized pieces in a pace I choose. A pleasure to use.,5
The foundation for each course is well constructed with real word problems to solve using interactive tools.,5
"I really love how they bring in smart thinking lessons. I use other learning platforms, but Brilliant is so far the best",5
Has frozen on my galaxy tab9+ tablet multiple times within the first hour. Phone version no issues at this time.,3
I'd definitely recommend this app to learn about anything and everything. Good work Brilliant team!,5
"I love this app, yet it saddens me that I cannot maintain a subscription because the price is a little bit too high for me.",5
This game is so fun challenges you you can do whatever you want and I also like for my my audience with it so information only and if she's the best thing you would I definitely recommend so it's been a 5 story because well I've been through my game and we've done so I was waiting and mother christben one then the game's been done and they can just keep doing it Uber and Uber and I live cause it's really nice and it's really fun and I think on this book Billy is the best,5
"I wish the would stop asking me to allow notifications every couple of days. No means no, thank you.",4
"Takes forever to load even small lessons, almost unusable with a bad internet connection, no offline mode",1
After some time after downloading the app it just starts crashing almost as soon as I open it. It's fixed for some time if I redownload but starts doing it again not long after,1
"I really really really enjoy this app. 5 stars? Nah, 1000 stars. Simple UI and great animation make it so easy to understand, even for kids. Good job Brilliant! hope we have astronomy course tho",5
"Unfortunately, it is impossible to use it for free, only first lesson of each course is free, after that you must pay.",1
This app is great so far. It really makes me feel interested in learning math (again).,5
Great app to learn. Simplified learning and you can actually learn here.,5
Love the app and the maths exercises but the price is ridiculous. Way way too expensive for what you get.,5
There's no free option. They require a credit card from moment 0.,1
Could have more courses but otherwise it's helpfulness is incomparable,5
Great app for the curious mind! Good for children and adults alike.,5
So many ads about this app everywhere but content is poor and limited...,1
"Where is the quantum computing course? So I did some quantum computer course yesterday, I decided to continue today and can no longer find it in brilliant. Has it been removed??? Why???",3
"Love the content, but the app can be buggy sometimes.",4
"I love learning with an advertisement after every lesson. Apart form that, it's a great app.",4
The one single best app I used it really taught me programming and much much more,5
Brings science and maths in a way they never teach in schools due to time and resources limitations,5
Pls add text to speech feature I keep miss reading the questions and opitions to the questions,3
"Whoever made this is brilliant, i mean this is very good educational games",5
Great content. 4 starts because no offline mode. And way way too many notifications. Even after doing a lesson I get more notifications the same day. Give us some control please!,4
"Awesome app! Excellent for anyone seeking to develop STEM skills. However, I do have a few complaints. Firstly, some of the courses seem to be extremely outdated and old (you can see this by the design alone of the lessons in the courses). Secondly, development seems very slow in my eyes, as the newer courses have a few chapters only. In addition, the older courses are taking very long before they are updated. Lastly, there is no ""community forum"" feature, making interaction with others limited.",5
"This is, broadly, a good app, and one which will certainly accelerate your learning in these areas. The way in which it teaches the content is phenomenal, interactive and practical, something curriculums over the world would do well to emulate. It is almost worth the cost. Some issues exist, however. The lack of a scratch pad for multi step problems is simply prohibitive, hints are unhelpful, and there's zero feedback on suggestions. I've submitted dozens of reports and heard nothing back.",3
I absolutely love Brilliant! Its Truly Brilliant! I am super Grateful to Institute of Human Anatomy on YouTube for introducing me to this super Brilliant app. Helps me a lot understand concepts I have not been clear since my childhood!,5
"It's really a great app! Very innovative, the ui/ux is also really excellent! Not to mention, the number of courses and information is just incredible, especially in the problem solving realm. But I think the only thing this app misses is having offline content like downloading courses and exercises. I mean, I truly wish that the app has this feature because I'm always traveling, so it's really hard to get a good internet connection sometimes or even none on some planes. So please consider it🙏",5
"This does not really qualify as learning. It is way more focused on entertainment. The amount of exercises is extremely low, and you only get quizzes to check some basic progress, but not really all the necessary practice. The entertainment is OK, but extremely limited in the free trial (not a single full course), and the paid one is very expensive for something that just qualifies as entertainment. Can't recommend to anyone. Oh, and the notifications are childish.",2
"Very Good. You get quite a few 'lessons' (?) In the free version for each subject. Definitely worth upgrading to Premium at some point. For some odd reason, as of writing this the app will not open on my Android phone - just keeps looping the boot animation without ever opening. It worked fine last night, every other app on my phone and my internet is fine so, . . . ? (Edit) now it is working but it took a long time - x30 seconds to x2 minutes to open.",5
"It's a great app. I'm doing A level physics and A level maths (I'm british). Despite it being an American app (different courses, curriculum), it's very good at helping me to understand the skills and concepts. I struggle with electric/magnetic fields, electricity and circuits in physics, and this app has helped a lot. It has diagrams, pictures, some lessons include example videos of the experiments and encourage you to try for yourself. It asks for your age, occupation and lvl of understanding.",5
"I have been using Brilliant for almost a year now for learning math, and I have noticed a change in my math skills and in my logical thinking. I think everybody should try it and choose a topic that suits them and I think it helps a lot with keeping the mind active and engaged. Also, I got to admit, learning new things or relearning old things in a new and easy way makes you feel better about yourself. Thank You Brilliant, keep the good work!",5
"This is absolutely Brilliant! I love how this app teaches you some concepts that you have no idea about it before! Drawback is though the explanations in the courses are not really understandable, like Brilliant thinks you already have great knowledge of a specific course even though you are just beginning, so it's kinda hard to understand. But if you'll keep on going through the course, you'll eventually know why. I'd love to purchase Premium but I still cannot earn money 😭",4
"The app seems very promising from the free preview, although I did feel the questions which guided me on a path were a bit misleading (I chose Maths and stated my knowledge as basic algebra, which gave me some lessons on basic algebra - I'd have expected lessons at a level higher than my current knowledge). However, an upfront payment of over $100 for a 12 month subscription is way too much. If there was an option to pay per month, I'd be much more likely to sign up.",3
"I.e. Calculus courses (derivates/integrals) have some great explanations. However, there is no real 'practice' part, which allows the learner to simply *train* calculating. Don't forget to cancel your premium subscription (auto renewal by default). I just got billed the full price for (yearly) renewal. Right now, they offer a 20% discount (see their website) for new accounts 🤔",3
"It is amazing. All the topics of science and engineering that I like are included. An the method of learning are perfect, very well described, focus on the important sentenses. It might look very easy, but the most important details are included, and every information here is completly understood. Unfortuanelly, it is extreamilly expensive. I can't afford it 😔",5
"Update 2024-03. Reinstalled to see if anything has improved. No. Now, by default set to send updates to your phone about 'streaks' and league tables. Really annoying. Turned it all off. Courses are no longer broken into small chunks, but run into long texts more reminiscent of an academic book. Brilliant used to do a few courses well. Now it's quantity over quality. Still no offline mode.",2
"Great app, way too expensive! The free version is great as an insight, and I can tell the app is going to be a great one. However the price of the full version is way too much. Monthly subscription costs thrice more than paying for a year up front, and the yearly subscription is still in three figures! I would happily pay a few pounds a month for this, but not more.",3
"While it may seem that brilliant is an app that expands critical thought and logic, it really isn't. Yes the daily questions are really good, but I implore everybody to not sign up for the cash grabbing subscription service. Regardless of price it is still terrible. The concepts are essentially explained through a stripped-down wikipedia page and then you solve a bunch of extremely basic or hard questions. You can learn concepts from better cheaper sources such as Khan Academy and most of the questions (and their answers) are freely available on the internet. The only only good learning tool is the use of sliders for graphs. However, desmos can be used as a replacement that is free and has more options. I would recommend solving the daily problems but it would be sensible to steer clear from paying for the courses; and opting for cheaper, better sources.",2
"This app was pretty good. Until most recent update. Now it's cumbersome, counterintuitive and annoying. It was nice and clean with access to daily challenges, stats, etc. Most recent update feels like downgrade few years back. Update 2020-03-28: the features and intuitive navigation has been brought back, reverting the update or rather downgrade described above. Thank you so much.",1
"I absolutely love Brilliant - I tend to use the Website over the phone app, but in either case, I find them both - well... ""Brilliant."" I fell off in Maths in early high school, and Brilliant has a bunch of courses on all the fundamentals that are helping me catch up in my late 20s! I would recommend this learning tool to absolutely every person on earth who is able-bodied, linguistically able & who can afford / lives in a country able to use it!",5
"Appreciate it! Brilliant is absolutely Brilliant! I can learn math and science interactively.Brilliant is best for students. As a student myself I can say you can gain your knowledge and experience here in Brilliant and upgrade your knowledge to the max. Like mine,even I as a high schooler,I decided to try and learn calculus, and surprisingly It is yet simple to understood and the incredible interactivable visualisation with explaination. If you haven't try Premium. I really recommend you to try",5
"Brilliant has been one of my favourite apps since I discovered it when I started my physics degree. I recommended it to my friends and some times we spent time together working on interesting challenging problems. Now the weekly problems have been replaced by the daily problems, which are well explained but far from the level of interest of the old ones. I have to say that I am profoundly sad and a bit disappointed about this. I feel bad for giving a bad score, I really wish you change your mind",2
"There are numerous problems. Some animations don't work, but interaction with them is required for learning as the text summaries are often bad. Offline mode doesn't load all the graphics. Even the first course the app recommended seems not to have been user-tested on a non-expert audience, omitting required information to solve quizzes. The only way to contact support is by manually writing an email, which means issues will not be efficiently reported, so I assume things will not improve.",1
"This has been amazing to help me understand programming. I haven't even finished level 2 yet of the CS & Programming course and been able to understand what is happening in my access database writing code to create a special calendar. Even if you know a little, it's fun and engaging to go through the lessons and challenges. Just make sure you read the questions properly first!",5
"The daily activity doesn't always register properly. I ened up wasting the streak extension because of this. This happens when a lesson is finished. Next day I got my day filled by just clocking ""Finish lesson"" 😑 super annoying. I lost my previous streak because of bug like this. The app ui is hard to crasp. I want a top-level flow chart view of my active and finished courses",4
"Great content, many interesting problems to solve. The concepts are explained very well so even a person with a non science background like myself can understand and relearn. However on my oppo android phone the app always crashes on startup. Force stopping it in app management doesn't fix the issue, neither does restarting the phone. Only redownloading the app gets it to work properly. This issue can be bypassed by using the browser version but unfortunately it's slightly less optimized.",4
"Brilliant is amazing. I'm not sure how it is for beginners, but I can say for advanced learning, it is fantastic! I'm a professional software engineer and I'm learning about cryptocurrency (hash functions, blockchain) in detail and the way it explains is really intuitive and great! The explanations don't skimp on detail or dumb it down, but still present the information in the most efficiently understandable way, employing visuals and interacting elements.",5
"Edit: I really liked this app while I was on the free trial. I was going to continue my subscription, but I needed to wait a week. So I cancelled the subscription in the app before the trail ended. Today they have tried to charge my account twice. Fortunately there was no money for them to take. But needless to say, I am extremely unhappy about this situation. Really well thought out app. Makes learning easy.",1
"Been using Brilliant for a while, and it's honestly... Not great. It desperately needs a dark mode, this app burns my eyes like nothing else. A lot of their more advanced courses (particularly their calculus derivatives/integrals course), run a million miles ahead and I have no idea what's happening. Nowhere near enough practice sessions. They need to take a leaf out of Duolingo's book on stuff like the practice centre lessons, plus give us daily goals beyond ""solve 3 problems keep streak""",3
"Must say I am a bit dissapointed. I saw a couple of adverts, tried the app and wanted to go premium for a year but what I really hate is this auto renewal of the subscription. And it is also very hard to find the way you can turn the auto renewal off before the subscription. I also found some annoyed reviews of a people that had trouble to switch the auto renewal off. So I will not go premium in this case and I really think that I am not the only one. But this app I really wanted to try.",3
"Overall informative and entertaining. Has glitches in paid content, e.g. in Algorithm Fundamentals, ""Continue Course"" doesn't take you where you left off (partial 'ring' on top right), but to the next full section. Section ""Sorting an array"" cannot be finished: button on ""Review and reflect"" page is missing. The algorithm on page 7 of ""Insertion sort"" is wrong. Sometimes in courses with progress bar, a refresh is needed to see the next page, but overall they seem to have less problems ...",4
This is a well made and easy to use app that delivers learning in bite sized chunks. Things are only really let down by poorly worded/ ambiguouse answers and questions that are only loosely based on the learning material they are associated to. This is highly frustrating and don't even get me started on the use of emojis! One way to reduce the IQ of anyone.,3
"This App is the best one I ever tried in my Life. Though there are still a few things that can be improved. One of them is the Downloading Mechanism. It just doesn't work correctly, there is no way to resume a half downloaded course. And sometimes it just doesn't download at all. Whenever there is an update for a particular course I have to redownload the whole course, that is aweful. It doesn't even show what point in the course has been updated. I hope it gets even better.",4
"Absolutely lives up to every word of praise you've heard from every YouTube ad. Cleverly constructed lessons and logical explanations of key concepts, with just enough whimsy mixed in to keep it light and fun. The interactive diagrams make it easier to understand the relationships at play behind each problem, and when you get something wrong, it's explained why in a way that doesn't feel disheartening. Their customer support is also amazing, professional, and pleasant through and through.",5
"Update: App is greatly improved. Courses so far well done, but price is simply too high for what the app delivers. I love the idea but the implementation is horrible. Hire a new SW team and try again. Text was either invisible or same color as background so I could not continue with evaluation. Deleted before I could try a single lesson.",2
"The new streak system is a poor idea, in my opinion. Not only do you need to complete a full lesson now in order to maintain your streak, but returning to a lesson does not add to your streak. Surely revisiting lessons should be encouraged as a way of ensuring that we fully understand the lesson at hand and are therefore ready to move on to more challenging lessons? You can, of course, still repeat lessons, but why change a very encouraging function of the app?",4
"I usually don't write reviews, but this IS brilliant! Love the challenges, the graphics are cute, but simple and there's a little humour in there too. Whenever I feel stuck, the explanation will make everything clear. Fantastic way to workout your brain, while having fun...and one of the few apps I would actually pay for, only to unlock all the puzzles. Thank you, devs, for creating this amazing app! Highly recommended.",5
"Good, could be great, but..... This app has helped me some maths equations in a way i never thought I could. Got my gcse's 20 years ago, needed them recently and wasn't up to scratch. This app has helped massively! But! There's not enough repetition with what's being taught. The practice sessions need to have 30+ questions of the same type to ensure understanding. For what is a paid service i think that seems logical. Otherwise all you're teaching is how to answer the question in front of you",4
"I installed the app and was impressed with the great content. Of course the free content is limited and I agree with that - it takes time to produce enjoyable learning material and it's done brilliantly here.  When the app advertised a discount for the premium subscription I gladly accepted it. I am sure it is worth the value. However, I never got access to the premium content and the app kept advertising the discounted price to me with a countdown.  Therefore I tried to contact support and all they had to offer after days of telling me that they usually respond in well below 24 hours was that I might have subscribed with another account. Seriously? The app should take care of that given that I used the in-app payment.  Just got the refund of my subscription price from Google, not sure if I will ever try again even though the offering seems compelling to me.  Update: Support got back to me and even re-enabled the discount I was offered before. Now the premium subscription worked. I am updating my rating to three stars and will update based on my experience with premium.",3
"This is seriously one of the best learning apps I have ever used. I've paid for others before and received an ok experience in one topic (eg: computer science) but with Brilliant, the amount of things covered is so vast and detailed, you can spend hours on each topic. Definitely worth the money. I would love to see it get more updates with more topics and greater detail!",5
"Really good but why so different from iOS? It's shockingly surprising that iOS version has offline mode but Android does not have it. That is extremely useful feature. Why is it missing on the dominant platform??? I'm so frustrated.  UPD: Good to see a prompt reply from the developer! Also glad to know that work is in progress on the same functionality for Android. Hope to see the updated version soon. Apart from that it's a well designed app with a high quality and carefully prepared content. I wish I had it while I was studying in school/university. First I was in doubt if it's worth paying for but finally decided to try. No regrets so far. Will give 5 stars when offline mode finally arrives to Android, it's the only thing I'm missing in the app.",4
"Brilliant itself doesn't need introduction - it is a fantastic platform. The app has a few cons, althou content is perfect. The new courses have broken UI. Also the new courses are replacing old ones, which had far superior UX. And since the old ones won't last forever, I hesitate to start them and lose progress - I want to keep them for review and reference. Now split screen, or popup view with notebook or calculator for example on Galaxy Note still refreshes Brilliant making it cumbersome.",3
"I haven't used this for very long. 3 days at the maximum, so please take this review with that knowledge in-mind. For someone that has never programmed a day in my life, it has challenged me upto the edge of my limited capability so far and been kind with the increases in challenge as I improve. And this of course the best way when I comes to our mind's capacity to learn and to fulfill the emotional needs to feel it is rewarding, intriguing, & fun, without making it overwhelming or tedious 👏",5
"Love all the courses and the way it's divided into bite sized lessons. Whenever I have a couple of minutes I do a lesson. Only thing is the free version isn't very useful as all courses will only have 4-5 lessons which isn't really worth it. While I personally feel the paid version is really worth the money, I wish they could introduce a model similar to Duolingo so more people could access it",5
Great App. I have used this App almost everyday for 4 months now - (lost my streak on day 99 😔) I love how it challenges you and continues to mix things up a bit. My only criticism is that I think it would be a really good thing if we could get some feedback when raising a ticket to help report a problem or an issue within the App.,4
"Ive rewritten this review as I come up to a year, changing from a 2 to a 1. The price is extortionate for an infinitely scalable product like an app. No explanation of how the training tab is used, or how it integrates with the rest of the topics. Some explanations are terrible. Examples: elminiation grids are not given an intro, the golden ratio is introduced outside of an algebra course, the rule of motion is given, then immediately disproven. High price, no intro, bad explanations.",1
"After about 10 hours of exercises, I am much further along in my programming language ability than I was after almost 2 semesters of college. Bonus: I'm not in student debt up to my eyeballs, and I don't have to take mandatory courses in language studies, sociology and general electives that add up to a wasted semester. These courses are, well, Brilliant!",5
"Love the courses, but the app itself is terrible. More often than not I cannot continue courses from where I left off (gets stuck on the previous course), and I frequently can't scroll through the pages of each quiz without first opening up the 'Report' menu and quitting back out. May as well just use the website through your browser.",1
"I like the content of the Brilliant app but I’m disappointed that it lacks a basic feature like a course reset button. I started the Solving Equations course, but found it too advanced and wanted to start over. However, I could only reset individual lessons and then do practice questions without lesson content. This is unacceptable, given the app’s high cost. I’m not getting my money’s worth and wouldn’t recommend it.",1
"Brilliant is brilliant. With well explained topics, over 60 intriguing courses, and a user friendly interactive system, it's one of my favorite learning apps I've downloaded. I'm 14 and I work from home, so I use apps like these for genuine school work. My only two points of criticism is that I would love a little description of how long each course and each lesson is estimated to take, and a small optional 5-10 question test at the end of each lesson or course, to review what I've learnt.",5
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. ✨️ This app is literally brilliant. Fun, Easy to use and simple UI. Who ever cooked shouldn't stop🔥🔥stay in the kitchen bruh. Don't stop releasing new courses, build state of the art curriculums, diversify and integrate. Go deeper into other courses and teach the ones that go along with them and I'll subscribe for life.",5
"Tge interactive feature in the app is quite useful and makes it fun to learn, the newest update in the app how ever has canceled a very cool feature the older edition had. Until few days ago, there was a category called 'popular Learning Path'. This made it so easy and useful to keep track of one's progress and allowed the user to kinda design his/her own corriculum. I found it so great to follow a path that is pre-designed If the app goes to its original layout, my rating willgo up to 4 stars.",2
"Great, super interesting topics but I think they could be dumbed down a little more. I could just be dumb LOL, but an example is the toilet explaination - the first diagrams don't show where the water from the tank is being pumped when you flush, so I wondered where the water was being pumped to. It also wasn't blatantly said that the pressure of the siphon was created due to pressure created by the speed and force of the water release (or at least it wasn't obvious).",4
"excellent learning crammed into a neat application. some of the lessons make assumptions of your skill level on the topic. you also definitely need a pen and paper for calculating some of the answers. sometimes it also escalates the skill too quickly and sometimes too slowly. however this is all manageable and enjoyable as you still learn as you go along. the reason it's not 5*. PLEASE USE SI UNITS!!! Stop using American measures such as feet, gallons and miles. science doesn't use those!",4
"Was really interested in this app when I found it; I had a lot of fun working out some of the first problems. However I am completely turned away from it based on the price. $30 CAD per month is ludicrous, even the annual rate of $9.59 per month ($115.08 per year) is absurd. I'd happily pay outright for this app, could even convince me to pay $20-30, but a subscription is insane.",2
"Supper buggy wasn't like this before but for whatever reason very often refreshes with the ""hang tight lesson loading page"" popping up whenever I go back onto the app or whenever I try to go back to the main menu by pressing the X button at the top left or swipe to go back to go to the previous page. Please fix this issue fyi it was experienced on my Android phone.",2
"I have to admit, the premium is expensive but so worth it. I've been looking for an app like this for months and lucked upon it after watching Kurzgesagt. I'm going through Mathematical Fundamentals right now and hadn't realised prior just how much my maths skills had deteriorated. If you'd like to learn and actually enjoy it along the way, this is seriously the perfect app for you!",5
"Nice idea but many errors. I'm testing this on subjects I'm familiar with and found at least one thing per lesson that was factually wrong or misleading. Additionally, when contacting support, they only responded to some of my messages. I'd expect at least a note that it's been added to the backlog. Finally, a feedback button should be present in the lessons in order to allow pointing this stuff out where it happens. Brilliant is probably forgoing lots of user feedback because of this.",2
"Awesome app, but I must change my review because it has a few bugs. One that is really bothering me is that it doesn't save the results when I redo a quiz. Sometimes I have to redo it twice to make it save the progress, sometimes it just won't save it, no matter how many times I redo the quiz. This last one is happening now with the quiz ""Superpositions"" in the Quantum Computing course. Please fix these bugs, because this app is pure gold.",2
"A bit pricey (at least to mid-income countries), but it’s definitely a new way of learning concepts intuitively. The app constantly asks you things in clever ways, so you can iteratively check if you're really getting it or not. There's some animations here and there, and some of them are really cool. The best part are the interactive lessons/visualization of concepts. Outside of lessons, the app interface could be better. I still don't know how to hop between learning paths on mobile",5
I will leave a review here as there is now feedback section on the website besides the one at the end of a course. Brilliant sometimes does a very good job at explaining the principles of a physical phenomenon and sometimes I'm having a stroke trying to read the texts. For a paid product it's really a shame. I can't get over the fact that it uses British units and there is no option to change the units to metric. And no dark mode :(,1
"Just awesome! You learn everyday something new in an interesting way. You are ""forced"" to think about science problems from another perspective and then you are gradually building intuition, which you can use to solve many others problems even every-day ones :) It is kind of sad, that probably major part of content is accessible only to premium accounts (paid ones), but even so you can at least do the introductions to some courses and still enjoy for example daily problems.",5
"I initially loved it. The first few courses and lessons were great! It was well paced, well explained and easy to follow along and learn. Sadly that doesn't stay the case. Now it's just walls of text with no real explanation. It's become frustrating because I don't understand half of what's happening or why and find myself unable to learn or digest the new content... If this keeps up, I will be cancelling my subscription. It's become nothing but frustrating! Also hate the leaderboard!!!",1
"I have been a user for about 2 years, the app was/is good but they dropped maintenance of the offline mode. Meaning they now require an active connection for anything. For me this cuts out about 30% of its use cases. Using it while traveling forces me to either hotspot and use my own data or hunt for (mostly unsecure) wifi. I don't see any improvements that justify this feature drop. I am checking the alternatives to this app and will probably drop it in the near future.",3
"Something changed. In 2020 I kinda left the learning on pause, came back now. It seems they completely changed the content of the courses. By my luck, 2 subcourses got restarted and I had to take them again. The explanations that were written as texts were gone; there are now explanations after a couple of exercises, instead of one for each, and they feel as if though they are explaining things to a 2-year-old. I want to understand things on my own - after all, isn't that what maths is about??",1
"I've a 43 day streak and I'm getting more familiar with the app and its fantastic you have plenty of content and new things coming. It's challenging but fun, the content is well researched and will guide you through it. It's a bit expensive but If you commit in one year you will for sure have benefited from it. I would add custom courses with things you have already learnt and struggle the most to keep learning after the first time doing it. Highly recommend!",5
The app is good. However there is this only thing which annoyed me for a while now. Everytime I'm controlling a graph it's so annoying that it always swiped to the next quiz. Can you please remove that annoying feature? I can move to the next quiz by clicking the bar on the top so please remove that annoying one. It's not so helpful when using a graph.,3
"Great idea, content and design, but the app is so buggy! I often can't scroll the lessons or resume at the point I left it at (screen is blank), submit exercises, load lessons... What a waste of what would have otherwise been an amazing app. I thought of subscribing to premium and would still consider it in the future if the issues are fixed. Currently the app is simply unusable. Such a shame.",1
"Brilliant is not that illuminating if you want to learn about a subject in depth. It will only present you with a series of puzzles with limited tuition along the way, and each course is v. short. I think the courses would be too basic for some with prior knowledge and not at all detailed enough for someone wanting to learn something new. It's a nice concept but falls short. The visual element is good but not employed in every course. You'd get a lot more for your money with Udemy (or similar).",2
"I don't even know where do start. The puzzles are fun. But the actual app functionality is rubbish. The progress keeps getting deleted, there are random moments when the next button is disabled despite completing the challenge, making the user start the chapter new (you go out of the app and back in and the already completed bits are gone from the chapter). It's very frustrating to use or actually keep track of progress - because it keeps deleting itself... Totally overpriced for what it is.",2
"I have the premium version. These are straightforward questions that are engaging that promote learning, just from that I would recommend it. My favourite part though, there is 0 punishment for failure. You just choose the ""show explanation"" and move on. No trail showing your failures. Really helps me push and keep learning when failure is just a blip on the radar that fades immediately and you're taught the correct way to do it. Would recommend.",5
"Best of its kind demonstrative & gamified maths principles. I'm reestablishing foundation in the basics but it has longevity. The only thing I feel that would improve it so far, is being able to resize the screen to keep more than one problem in view; As well as being able to maximise the screen to eliminate all other tabs & taskbar. I haven't tried the app yet. Oh - and the maths-centric language is ridiculously (and perhaps excessively) dry. 5 stars none-the-less: the language might even help.",5
"This is exactly what I need! It's so much fun to learn like this. The courses are excellent, and relearning my maths is quintessential now as my son is going to secondary school in a couple of years, so ideally, I need to brush up more than just a little in order to support him properly. I don't feel too bad when I make mistakes in the lessons. It's not as punishing as school was in the eighties!",5
"This app is great, understandable theory, attractive animation, learning become enjoy. But, unfortunately we have to subscribe to premium to get more access, otherwise the lessons we get are really really limited. Our advice, maybe you can use advertisements for free students, instead of having to subscribe, especially since students don't have income yet. Thanks...",3
"Amazing app. A subscription is worth it because of the courses. A constant expanding library of content (math, physics, computer science, chemistry and biology). They assume you know nothing, teach from first principles. Guiding you through problems and real world scenarios. Suddenly you find the equations yourself. Many ""aha!"" moments. Visual, interactive animations clarify complex concepts. Authors with PhDs, giving insights into current challenges, familiarizing you with academic vocabulary.",5
"Great app, where you can really learn something. Two things I currently don't like: one, is that there is no option for the app to stop the screen from turning off. So when I'm solving a problem on paper and want to turn to the app, my timer setting will have turned off the screen, whereupon I have to tap it open again and so forth. Two, is that you now get the same ""You viewed the explanation"" message, whether you peek at the solution or view it after having solved or failed the problem.",4
"The courses look varied and interesting, even for advanced students, but every course I looked at only let me do a few lessons before demanding that I subscribe, but the price for a month is too high, and I am not willing to pay for a whole year without trying it out for a shorter period. The developers should reduce the monthly cost and offer individual courses for micro payments.",2
"First impressions of the app are that it's inconsistent. As an educator trying to create a classroom and courses for students to follow, I'm finding that the classroom options keep disappearing for the students. We've reverted to the website for now, which seems to be much more reliable. I'd also welcome more filtering options to help find suitable courses for students of different ages and abilities.",2
"This app is really great- the puzzles are fun, you feel like you learn a lot and the explanations are excellent. However, it's also a very frustration app to use for two reasons - firstly, theres no where to write notes for solving problems so you either have to have a pen and paper or switch between apps. Secondly, there is no way to quickly access the explanations of past quizzes so if you can't remember how to do something you need to go through all the past modules to find the explanation",4
"The courses are great and I like that you can learn a fair bit for free. However, there is not an option to pay monthly equal to the price of the yearly subscription. With the year subscription costing £100, it is difficult to pay for premium as most people cannot shell out that kind of money in one go. So please, developers, add a pay monthly option equal to the value of the yearly subscription, as most of us cannot afford 3x the yearly price for the privilege of paying monthly.",4
"The app looks great. I used it for 20 minutes only, but I encountered on something odd. The scroll of the slides( up/down) is counterintuitive to me. Sometimes the active part of that allows scrolling is on the bottom of the screen, but sometimes it is on the top. It is not designated and it could be frustrating. If that is fixed, I would give 5 stars.",4
On the whole it's quite informative. But the exercises (and the explanations) quickly become frustrating. Figuratively speaking you're too often supposed to be able to accomplish a perfect double flip backwards after doing ten sit-ups. I'm often ranting... which isn't a sign of me having fun or learning anything new. I'm probably just a very dumb person.,3
"The content is good and there are a lot of good courses that are helpful and practical. However, I have been encountering a big issue regarding the user interface. When I go into the course I am currently on (Algorithm Fundamentals) the screen flickers black and white across the screen of my phone (Samsung galaxy A50) and I can't continue that course. It does appear to be just that course, so otherwise a very good app.",4
"really love this learning platform, it's intriguing, fun and stimulating. I've always felt uncomfortable with my science skills because they were so broken. but the sheer creative and playful setup along with great communication makes this programme a pretty successful initiative to learn from. however, I would like to see that Brilliant decreases the membership price in the future. it's simply far too expensive for most people and I don't see the point (for anyone) in those incredibly high fees",4
"The content is brilliant but the bugs in the app are off-putting. So many things are not optimised for mobile screens. Sometimes I can't see half of the picture 😕. Often there's no way to go back in the course, which you'd need to refresh certain things. No dark mode... In general, user experience quite poor. I won't renew my subscription unless you fix it.",2
"Lovely. The pictures, daily challenges, explanations. Even the free version has a lot to offer. On the other hand, it's a pity about the monthly payments. What about paying for access to chosen category? Or maybe lowering the price a bit? Yearly subscription looks interesting, but that's quite a lot of money for people outside US, using different currencies.",5
"A great app if you like challenging content. The learning curve can be a bit steep, but the courses are impressively well designed and do a good job training your intuition rather than just making you memorize content. One minor improvement I'd like to see is whiteboard support for the puzzles: Many require pen and paper to solve and having those nearby can be a bit of a hassle.",5
"I use this app mostly due to lack of competition. Missing many UI futures, quality of courses varies, some are great, some are average at best. I can still recomend it because there is no other choice, I hope there will be one day. Edit: forgot my password, reset link doesn't work, support is unresponsive, it took a week to send me reset link.",3
"Out of all the education services I've experienced, Brilliant beats all of them by a long shot. Its courses are amazing, the variety is great (from the basics of mathematics all the way to computational biology ) and they have helped me see math in a new and interesting way. However, there are a few things it can improve, such as the implementation of more Physics courses and the catergorization of all topics on the wiki.",4
"Everything is well and fit for an app brilliant experience. As you know that the content it self for non subscribed and subscribed is very good (that's a review for another time), the condition are fine and well in a small screen, and I don't find any problem with the quality of the app. Of course, there are no add either options, and easy to use. Very recommended for on the go, and for everyone in general. If you don't know what's brilliant, you better find out because you won't regret it!!!",5
"Content is great, but the course download feature for offline learning just doesn't work. I didn't even get halfway through the first logic course before I had to switch to the online version. The problems relating to coins made of different materials and vaults were impossible to complete offline because the graphics for the options were replaced by a long string of text which was cut off and there was no way to tell which option was which. Not really good enough.",3
"Excellent way to get a better grasp of somewhat abstract concepts, incredibly expensive if your currency is cheap as compared to the US dollar. Annual subscription for someone in Brazil is about R$800! That's an insane amount of money to spend on one app, and there are FAR more cheap/free ways to learn these same subjects, albeit with less cute visuals. If 150 USD is easy to throw around for you, it might be worth your investment, but think long and hard about it. Free introductions though.",4
"Good content, basic app. Discontinuing the ability to use the app offline was extremely disappointing. The justification at the time was to focus on other app functionality. No dark mode is killing my use of this app. I want to use it in bed at night but the white piercing background always stops me. When completing courses, the continue and all navigation buttons are on the left hand of the screen. Much harder to use for right handed people than if the buttons were on the right hand side.",3
"Brilliant: Stellar STEM content, overflowing with knowledge. But for recreational learners like me, it's an ocean of info, hard to navigate. After 3 years, finding specific topics is still a struggle. Paths don't always connect naturally to curriculum, and custom libraries with adaptive practice (think leaderboards, leagues!) would be game-changing. Brilliant's UX has potential, but needs a map & compass to truly shine.",4
"I love the courses, hate the app. There's one very annoying glitch which causes quizzes that I've finished to not be marked as finished. Meaning every time I hit ""continue course"" it goes to a quiz I've already done, and I need to scroll all the way to where I am. Then I need to figure out which quiz I'm on, and if I get that wrong it resets the whole screen. EDIT* I reinstalled the app and it completely reset all my progress. Great! This app is infuriating.",2
"Awesome app. I'd pay for the premium if the price was lower. It's waaaaay too hight. Like, yes, it is a good app, but it costs more than 6 months of my gymnastics classes :D And they are with a coach, gym and everything :D Even udemy courses have way lower price, and they are unlimited, not for a year. Cut the price and a lot, A LOT of people will pay for the premium, and you'll get more than now with this ridiculous price.",3
"Brilliant is an amazing platform to develop passion for science and math. In my experience, it has helped me improve my way of learning through practice and patience. Especially recommended for high school math and beyond. The only issue I've been facing, as a premium member for a year is that the app keeps closing or shutting down on my phone and doesn't run smoothly. Hope you can get this fixed!",4
I am simply loving it!!! I am a social scientist and using it to make my Foundations stronger in maths and statistics!!!! Loving it fully,5
"Insanely awesome education app with plenty of courses and information that makes sure you really understand the course. The chances of you not understanding is.. Well, pretty slim. I use the free version at the moment which offers alot of content, like alot compared to other apps. Paid version is mostly if you want to become more big brain and smart🤩 Anyways, this educational app is one of the best, if not the best learning app I know, and I recommend for anyone wanting to become smarter!😎.",5
"Have been doing brilliant exercises for 2 years daily now! It's good learning. But, I have some complaints: 1... EDIT all the complaints were fixed over time with updates! I get reminders to continue my streak so I'm at over 1000 days now. It is easy to see which courses are completed and which are left. There's even a bar showing how much is completed. There are always new courses added so I was able to do a streak for multiple years to get to over a 1000 days!",5
"True way of learning anything is by interaction.Be involved with the course,feel it,live it, enjoy it. Who says learning has to be boring. Knowledge is power, but learning is super power!! A request to the developer to add a blank workbook with the courses for notes and calculations because writing something by your own hand is a life long memory!!",5
"Even if a small app, it's so useful because you can search (and then find) advanced mathematics and physics lessons. I thought initially it was only for beginners but that's luckily not true. Only an hint: can you create settings so that you can switch languages, please? Thanks in advance.",5
"The app is severely bugged in comparison to the desktop Web version. Once per lesson the app will get stuck (soft-locked), not allowing you to continue without restarting the app. Interactive parts of lessons don't fare much better. A recent example I experienced is when you had to adjust the interactive element until a symbol appeared then answer the question bellow as to what symbol appeared. However, no symbol appeared regardless of what the example was adjusted to.",2
"I wanted to like but no. Explanations are average. Some exercises have no explanations. They force you to subscribe for 1 year after 7 days of trial even though most of the content might not interest you and you won't have enough time to try everything. If after 7 days you are still not convinced there's no option but to pay. There are other options, some are free, to learn math, technologies, and science.",2
"This app is worth it's price tag. It has a heavy focus on math (logic, geometry, algebra, probability, calculus and some other interesting mathematical areas). It also many courses on computer science and natural sciences (physics for the most part). I am currently learning some computer science stuff which Brilliant covers nicely, but in not as much detail as Data Camp for example. I must say though the quality of the app content and delivery is superb.",5
I wish it had dark mode. Also there are few still concepts specially in maths needs you to refer on YouTube to better understand what brilliant app is trying to teach.,3
"Absolutely fantastic app, even though I've only used the free version. It's a bit sad that only people who can afford it can take their scientific/mathematical learning any further. But I do really appreciate the hard work put into making something like this, the absence of ads, and the interface. After a spending my formal education years in a system that doesn't accommodate learners with ADHD, this app is proving astonishingly helpful with my learning by answering the ""why"". Thank you. 💫",5
Really hope it is free 🥲🥲. But I understand—it's too good to be free. It teaches many stuff I don't usually learn in school. It also helps deepen my understanding. Excellent 👍🏻👍🏻,5
"Excellent service. App needs some improvement though. Many things in PC browser's version are missing here (like showing percentage of ppl answered a question correctly). App frequently stops responding to continue button and I have to go out of the course and come back to get it to work. I moved from 5 to 3 stars because I believe I must rate the app, not the service (which is awesome in my opinion)",3
"so much better than I expected! I'm really enjoying the computer science course and I'm surprised how well everything is explained, I'm learning so much. I'm doing way more than just a bite-sized lesson per day because it's really fun. currently one week into the trial month and I think I'll get the subscription afterwards, it seems worth it to me!",5
"The content itself is great but the price is ridiculous to put it mildly. The free version would be an overall better experience if they slapped an ad or two between every lesson, which is to say that you can't really use it at all as it is. Even if the free trial weren't a scam, it wouldn't give you enough time to learn everything you want to know. Save yourself a lot of money and scummy emails and go find your library card instead.",2
"I'm a graduated industrial engineer, working in the tech industry, thus you can guess it's very rare for me to use my college skills at work. Someday I was having a hard time doing a statistics math, which should have been pretty straightforward to me. I said ""no more"" and went straight to the subscription page since I've already known Brilliant for years now. And it's that good! It will definitely help me keeping my knowledge in good shape and of course, learn new things. Take the leap you too!",5
"A really great app! I'm honestly glad when i first found this app, understanding math has never been easier for me, there's still a room for improvement like adding more sound effects. My only disappointment was that you need to pay for a subscription if you want to access an entirety of the lessons. I'm kinda fine with it but yeah.",4
"Simply an excellent app. It's perfect for my specific use case, as a middle aged professional wanting to brush up on mathematics that I learnt 20 years ago and have subsequently forgotten. Bite sized problems that I can work on at my own pace during my work commute etc, clearly explained concepts and I feel a real intuition is being built up. Highly recommended, especially for those wanting to dust off the cobwebs!",5
"This is great for life long learners. I'm really enjoying leveling up my knowledge and skills. I'm a book worm, but I've got plenty of areas that I can improve. I may even grow to enjoy math, someday. For now I'll stick with logic, science, computers... But some day soon, I'll click algebra. Any app that can do that is gold. Pure Gold.",5
"I mostly love it. However, there is a bug in the app, whereby sometimes clicking continue course will take you back to a quiz that has already been completed, no matter how many times it is completed. Such a minor thing, if I could only drop half a star, I would!",4
"I'm normally very skeptical about products that YouTubers market. However, Brilliant rocks. I really enjoy the lessons that they put out since they're genuinely fun and bite-sized.",5
"I randomly found this app and ended up being way more interested in it than i expected. As a computer science student, the problems and courses available are great as learning content or brainteasers/games. My only gripe is the price of premium, which most content is locked behind, but it is understandable with the quality and detail of the content.",5
This is a superb learning method. I have used it for over 2 years now and notice countless updates and improvements over time. The website even works great on my e-ink tablet.,5
"Haven't felt this stupid since I was in high-school. The feeling is terrible. That being said, if you're not a moron like me, these courses are probably good. I wish you could retry questions that you get wrong. I am doing the introduction to math fundamentals logic questions. It sucks that instead of getting to try again on a similar but different question, you have to go through to the next one without really getting to apply the explanation to a new, similar scenario.",4
"Such a fun way to challenge yourself. Especially, now I got all the time in the world to do it. I just began with the warm-up logic course and I am already cracking my brain and making mistakes. But most importantly, I am actually having fun doing so and learning from my mistakes. You learn an important skill, deductive reasoning. Which is used in the natural sciences. Something that's was talked about and practiced during my Bachelor's Psychology. However, it was mostly inductive reasoning.",5
"It is generally brilliant! But could you please add a night mode? Because we students tend to stay many nights up studying and i do that using brilliant, however, im having headache and pain in my eyes these days, which doesn't improve my learning experience with brilliant but moreover prevents me from spending more and more time on its platform. So please, add a night mode.",4
"The app is amazing, but it is extremely expensive for people outside the US (maybe even for a large portion of the US population, too). You should REALLY consider charging in local currencies with prices made for them, especially in this challenging times. Otherwise you will be sacrificing expansion during a time when people are flocking towards digital. Remember apps gain the most in scale, not price",3
App is decently put together. But fails at the fundamentals: It cannot open the email link that is supposed to direct you to a quiz/question/challenge (From weekly Brilliant emails). Opening any such links just opens the app where it was last left off with no means of finding the question/challenge it supposedly links to. The app cannot play any of the videos it includes in quizzes/question explanations. It therefore renders the content of some of the courses inaccessible.,2
"The app is made excellent, I use both ios and Android app and I liked both of them a lot☺️. Please keep up the maths work, although I would like to see more of discrete mathematics and I am sure its coming. The solutions are fairly detailed, and the courses tends to be more practical than theoretical, which I like, but sometimes some theory is actually necessary before certain questions. I really their short videos thing in courses and would like to see more of them. Keep up the good maths work, I am not that good in mathematics but I seriously think if I continue then I'll get a lot better. To answer that if a subscription is worth it, I'll say it depends on you, are you good at maths? Do you require to be good at it? If these are the case, then it's absolutely worth your money.",4
"The content is good but removing the option to access courses offline was an absolutely terrible idea. Most of the time I want to access the courses is when the wifi is bad or nonexistent, so the app is now unusable for me unless I'm at home. I'm hoping they'll reverse this decision, but if not I'm cancelling my subscription as it just won't be worth the money.",2
"Its a good app but what I find frustrating is that it doesn't cover some subjects very clearly. For example, the gravitational potential energy practice course left me clueless. I checked the wiki pages and it provided no help. To sum up what I am trying to say, the wiki pages need to go over more subjects more thoroughly Also, when you have to answer a question to 3.s.f, the correct answer is nearly always rounded to 4.s.f",4
I enjoyed Brilliant initially and I opted to purchase the annual premium subscription. I found out after subscribing that I won't be able to access any video content from all courses because Brilliant routes every video through third party tracking platforms that I have blocked from my devices. Exploring Brilliant's privacy policy was also excruciating for its cavalier disregard for user privacy. I won't be renewing my subscription.,2
I can't even use it bc at home page it will not stop crashing. Edit: Thanks to the developers beacause now it works! It's a great app which I find great! Thanks again to the people who responded.,4
"This app is excellent, it teaches you stuff you might have already known but in a way that actually makes sense. The reason why this app is so fun is because it turns all learning into an interactive process and not just input, on the contrary it gives you very little input and lets you tackle problems and then explains the reason behind your thinking, thats the natural way of learning. I wish i had math teachers that could have taught us in this manner.",5
Changing my review from 2 stars to 5 stars. I found two bugs in the application and reported them using customer support who responded very quickly. The QA was able to reproduce the bugs and they are now reported for the developers to fix. Very good customer support and the bugs are now in the queue to be fixed. The QA also found short term workarounds for the issues so i'm no longer blocked from continuing the course. Good job!,5
Can't sign into app. Support not very helpful nor responsive. Prior to sign in issue there were various problems with progress not being saved or some courses not being accessible. I don't usually leave reviews but I'm very disappointed with this app and the experience. I will not be renewing my subscription.,1
"I didn't think I'd be any good at this app because I'm not great at maths, or thinking out side of the box. I still struggle a lot, but it's helping think differently than what I was taught in school - a very strict/ non creative way of thinking. So this is all very new. I'm glad I was told about this app by my husband! I just feel I need a bit more practice at things before the hard sections because I end up trying to guess after struggling to think of the answer. But I'm still learning!!",4
"This app is very well planned, it's useful and interesting. Downside is that is also extremely expensive. So it will only reach people who can afford spend a lot on app subscriptions. Other small problem is that the streak only counts if one use it on the online mode. Do a course only on the offline mode and the streak goes back to 0.",4
"Amazing app, really recommend it's good for learning alegrabra easily and slowly",5
"Keep Going! Compare to others, I found this is useful app, but not all at once. Brilliant enhances your Math and Physics skill rather than others. Apps such Khan can be more recommended because they're advanced in some ways, but diversity in fields, free and score more clear. As well, the cost is a bit much.",3
"I'm not giving five stars due to high prices. However, it's the best learning app I've tried in a while. Its interface, exercises and topics are first-class. Whether you have an 'old' phone or not, your experience will be kind of laggy. Nonetheless, give it a try whenever you want, you won't regret it!",4
"Static content - they don't care if you did well, they won't come back to repeat what you understood wrong. You have to go back by your own. Xp rewards/leagues - No way to opt out, some lessons give you more, some almost none Progress syncing of unfinished lessons is broken Too little interactive tasks, and when they are interactive, the UI/UX experience is bad Too expensive for what it is, country based pricing doesn't reflect the individual country economics GDPPC",2
"Simply Brilliant!!! Really intuitive exercises and explanations. It's not the usual boring math we do at college, it's fun and interactive. It's like a game here, where our brain is constantly put to test. Highly recommended for anyone who hates college math because of the way it had been taught or because of lack of understanding, and would like to experience the true essence and beauty of math.",5
"Such a wonderful brain training app. Great for those of us who are obsessed with analysis and like to hyperfocus on data problems with real world, interactive lessons. Huge range of high quality, self-paced courses that cater to a just about any skill level. Highly recommended to anyone who has an interest in developing their applied understanding of science and mathematics, or just anyone who likes to challenge themselves and keep sharp with some entertaining and informative puzzles.",5
I like learning new things with this app. I think it should have a sign though for tasks that require pen and paper. I like to learn on the train and for most tasks that's no problem as they really don't require pen and paper. Maybe a little integrated notepad would be nice. Actually I often switch to my calculator app or notes app and that works too.,5
"I just downloaded it on a whim thinking it would just be a fun time waster, but I was surprised to find that it contained better learning material for what I'm currently learning at school than what we were recommended. It's still missing some courses I think would have been really useful, and it's a bit pricey, but still way cheaper than actual school books. I think I may recommend it to our algorithms teacher",5
"Had a Brilliant sub and really enjoyed it. So much so I paid for another so my daughter could use it. Unfortunately Brilliant then locked me out of my subscription and couldn't resolve the issue. They made it my problem to try and recoup money from iTunes. They were very sorry, but tough luck. Great content, hopeless company. Really disappointed",1
"I'll put it simple. Brilliant is brilliant. It's very informative. The more you exel with it, the more addictive it gets. 5 stars easy. If you want to actually learn, do it with brilliant.",5
"It's easy to get lost in the choice. I subscribed via watching Sabine Hossenfelder's YouTube channel. I actually wanted to learn more about Quantum Mechanics. I ended up signing into other courses. I have learned at last not to get bogged down when I find myself struggling with something. If you are not enjoying something, you can stop and try something else and then later go back to it. In the intervening time, you may have learned something that helps you when returning to a paused course.",5
"I didn't update but the Mathematical fundamentals course interactives are working fine, I haven't checked other courses at this moment. Raising from 2 stars rating to 3 stars. Previous review (Not deleting in case interactives fail again): I am using the paid version, which allows to navigate all the content courses, yesterday it started failing to display interactives. Trying to solve the issue is too time consuming. Maybe the free version does not have this issue.",3
"I just had to do it, sorry. It's really great and all but it's also rather laggy and straight up crashes all the time. I've done some Multivariable calculus for my upcoming math exams and it's really great but on mobile it sucks so much I had to get it on PC. Would recommend?✔️ Would recommend on phone?❌ Maybe it's just my phone acting up but it's best to either use another app/technique for learning or use it on PC. Sorry, but 3⭐ only.",3
"Slick learning app, I really wanted to sign up to try premium for 1 month, on the billing page it says 15.49 euro (I get that it should be only for the first month), then when I click on the button the bill on google pay becomes 21.49 (5 euro added without any explanation whatsoever). Seems a bit disingenuous to do this, also I signed up through sponsored link but received no discount lol. The app itself is great, but I don't get the billing trickery therefore I will not sign up.",2
Sometime in the middle of quiz the continue button stops working but closing the app and reopening it solves the problem. It's not a serious problem but I don't know what is causing it. I have the premiumand I really enjoy taking courses. There are interactive and progressive. But content of these courses are not complete (Compared to my university lessons) But again it's not a problem because the app is made for foundamentals.,5
"I paid for the courses, not what I expected. Do not waste your money on this if your purpose is to learn something. They have tried hard to make everything as intuitive as possible, but the variety is very small. They removed the main course I bought the subscription 2 months after my purchase. My subscription ends after a month, and now the app began to show notifications so that I can extend it. So greedy. Spend your money on valuable skill courses rather than this massive scam.",2
"Brilliant app for learning essentials of science, math and technologies :)",5
"Signed up for a subscription with a free trial. Looked good, roughly $8.99 a month. They charged my card $156, No refund. Reported bugs while using the app no response. In short, I'm not using the app anymore. Very basic and boring lessons. Edit: I have already reported this to support, no refund or help with bugs.",1
"Actually usefull! It's a nice refresher on physics and math. The explanations and problems are well represented usually don't need much previous knowledge other than the courses provide. It also has no intrusive ads. It's one of the tare breed of apps designed for anything else but fleecing you for money. Definitely worth a try, even if you think you suck at math/physics and that this can't be fun. It is!",5
"Staff solutions for daily puzzles often use formulas and don't explain the intuitive logic they promise. The monthly subscriotion is only a feature of the app and not the site, which is dodgy. Its also kinda expensive. If you weren't trying to make me pay a $120 at once, I would be giving you more money over all, you would just get it in chunks. If you're willing to give it to me for $10/MO with yearly plan, just let me pay $10 monthly (single months cost double, lol)",2
"Great content; the app is horrible though. Doesn't allow me to scroll through exercises sometimes and sometimes the screen turns white while the bar under in the screen repeats ""validating purchase"" or ""your payment has processed"". The interactive graphs don't work at all and never have worked. I would only pay for this if you do the courses on pc, because the app is definitely mostely useless.",2
originally an amazing unmatched app. now it is floating with such an impractical counterproductive ui with a lot of restrictions that make the free version a slow and annoying experience till you get used to it. I preferred the old weekly challenge challenging system. im not sure how good is it paid but I am not impressed. this is a good example of why adding too much featurs isnt always the best,2
"Love the app, but it keeps sending me notifications in the dead of night and there's no way to tell it not to send me notifications in the middle of the dang night.",2
"After free month they charge you without notice!!! And they charge you A LOT!!! AND NO REFUNDS!!! DO NOT USE, I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! Only reason I used this is Kurgzgesagt recommended it, what a shame this service is a scam (NOTE: I have only used the app ONCE!! FRICKING SINGLE ONE TIME!!!)",1
"Pretty solid application for learning math, algorithms, etc. My only problem is the price you just can put ads and make it for free",4
Provides a unique learning experience and interesting problems. Been using it for over 10 years now.,5
"Content reasonable and ok, but quite pricy and playing like a scam with subscriptions prices: Early november annual subscription cost arround USD 76, magically on Black Friday, annual subscription promotion costs USD 113",2
It is an interesting idea and I love the concept. The vast majority of the app is behind a steep paywall though and the app regularly refuses to load for me so I'm uninstalling at this point. It genuinely is a great idea though and I was enjoying learning just the space on my phone is worth more than 10% of an app that won't load.,2
"To be very honest. I really appreciate the effort put into this. Explaining the foundation of things, it has been of much help. I would suggest the topic of physics were singled out so one can search for the a particular topic, the pathways are still a good idea though, the math beginner pathway has really helped me. Also please 🥺 more topics in physics. Thank you alot for your effort.",5
"Ease of use on a learning platform can sometimes feel childish (and I am not sure that completing Brilliant games is considered a valid form of certification.) However, I haven't been able to grasp concepts like this since I was a child. Food for thought, perhaps. In my experience, Brilliant is a wonderful tool for extending your mental reach in the fields of logic and math!",5
"Thanks to create one of my favourite app, its so interesting. but yeah the latest update make it hard to select lesson with ease than previous one as they just now providing the topic name but before a brief description added and also there's ui difference too, and now its like to go through whole rather than what you find interesting and unknown to you. and as its also not showing perquisites. Thanks for good learning experience.",4
"The app is awesome, but I think there are two major flaws: 1. Not enough practice for each topic, just a few more examples (I think it should be optional, and it won't be that difficult, you just need to change the numbers in the tasks you've already created) 2. No comments under the problems (where the community would be able to ask questions and get a deeper understanding from those who have already completed the task)",3
"At a certain point in every module, the lessons start becoming gibberish. For all the technical capacity, there is no feedback, no knowledge gap help, and no more than a single question on any given section of material. I've done years of stats, and I somehow came away understanding less. I went to Khan Academy to fill in gaps for certain mathematical concepts and just stayed there. There's a literal lesson on ""maximum profit function,"" regardless of the value, and they implemented it like pros.",2
Great experience so far (2 weeks in). Really good at encouraging regular participation thus form good regular study habits. Material is presented in clear and snack sized portions. Especially useful for those with precious little free time. Hoping it continues to be as instructive as the topics become more advanced. Will update review at a later date.,5
It's okay - I don't really care about the league and can't figure out a way to turn it off. The way in which you teach maths visually is rather more confusing than helpful in my opinion. Im on the fence right now as to whether or not I will remain subscribed but I feel as if my money would be better saved and for myself to focus on free resources in which provide both more depth and more value.,3
Amazing study tool to help plug any gaps in your knowledge or satisfy your innate curiosity. Worth the price point imo 10/10,5
Very clever and motivating learning material.,5
"I really wanted to like this app, but every lesson in the logic course has contradicting pictures and text and sometimes the text even contradicts the solution which makes it impossible to solve some of the exercises. It would only take a single person of the dev team to go through all the examples once to notice these bugs, which means no one ever proof-read them... glad I'm still in the trial version. Not gonna pay 100$ per year for a bug ridden app...",1
Exercises are not gradual or tailored to level of the person doing them. You should get inspired by elevate because their product is cheaper and much more personalised and fun. Why do you oblige to redo all the questions when one makes only a mistake in one? And then again the exact same qiestions? Not fun. One loses time to redo the same thing just for a small mistake at the last step. Also it is not clear the sequence one shop train. It is nit very intuitively presented like elevate. A pity.,3
"Tried the app once again in 2023 (after disappointing UX on mobile in 2022), and I have to admit that so far so good. It looks like they revamped the whole UI, which now works the same way on mobile app and on desktop in a web browser. Brilliant app (pun intended). And yes, you have to buy premium, but the content is worth it!",5
"A good app for learning STEM subjects, but the subscription model needs to be addressed. It is not worth dumping a lump sum of nearly £100 into. More affordable subscription plans will be needed before I even consider using this. Until then, try Khan Academy, which offers many of the same subjects and is completely free.",3
"DO NOT INSTALL. After you cancel your service, they will continue to charge you an annual fee of $113. Very shady practice.",1
"Please be aware that brilliant doesn't give you an account interface, and the first charge is for $204 after 7 days. Started a trial. Wanted to cancel. Didn't see the subscription in Google Play. Checked the app and website, neither of which allow you to do anything but exercises. No menu, no account management, no contact page. Just exercises. Today I was billed $204. The subscription had attached to an old Google account that I have Gmail setup on.",1
"OK but too expensive, especially for customers who can't spend too much time on their phones. Ps. I still bought the subscription however I've regretted doing so since these courses are very advanced (Taylor Series) & there are too few problems to practice to get it. I want problems to solve! ! !",3
Good content but horrible pricing for what it offers. You should introduce regional pricing. There's no way I can justify the annual subscription when for that money I can buy actual real life courses or books that will teach me much more in depth. Not to mention the plethora of free stuff available. I still think the content is good enough for casual learning. Just not worth the price. Save your money paying youtubers and give it to us the actual customers.,2
"Nice realised concept, best app in brain teasers. Now become more casual: one daily task with article, the beginner difficulty compared to old concept(there were 3 levels, but only problems). No addictive features (bad ones), so that why model and support will go down, not efficient for market(what makes more unique)",5
"Brilliant is a true gem in the world of online education. I've found Brilliant to be an invaluable resource on my educational journey. What sets Brilliant apart is its intuitive and text-focused approach. One of the standout features is the diverse range of courses available. Whether you're interested in mathematics, science, engineering, or computer science, Brilliant has you covered.",5
"This app is absolutely incredible! I'm thoroughly impressed with its well-organized presentation of information, complete with informative diagrams and captivating animations. It has significantly enhanced my understanding of various mathematical concepts. I can't help but feel a pang of regret for not having access to such a powerful platform during my school years.",5
Brilliant design! Makes learning challenging yet not forbidding. Best app ever!,5
"Total trash and ripoff. You're better off with khan academy or several other resources that are free, more in depth, and better. It has a nice user interface, but you can't use the vast majority of the content without paying literally hundreds of dollars. Not even a trial to see if it is worth it, no discounts. Nada. Trash.",1
This is just an extended scam to sign you up to a 'premium' subscription.,1
"Just one word to describe it - Brilliant! Apart from the UI, presentation and other things which are conspicuously awesome, its the way they have meticulously organized their courses for all sorts of subjects that won me over. Do give it a try, I'm sure you wont be disappointed.",5
Once you've done the free introduction lessons there's nothing to do in the app unless you pay. And it's very expensive - especially compared to Khan Academy that offers you a more in depth learning experience for free. Brilliant should consider tier subs. I'm not interested in half of their courses so am not prepared to pay to unlock content I won't use.,2
"Amazing... but! The subscription is just to high in my opinion. I'd like to pay for the app outright rather than a subscription of 10 pounds a month (for the annual, that is!), because it really is an incredible help in understanding new theories and insights of the world. Just sad I'm skint :(",2
It is fun and educational. Not memorising lists you are free to solve science problems with logic and maths. I get 4 out of 5 correct but it's the questions I get wrong I remember the most because the explanations that are offered after you submit your answer whether you have got the question right or wrong are always simply put and understandable to anyone. And because you learn through reading the explanations of the solutions you find yourself solving more questions. Still. Still fun in 2021,5
1. It explains the concept first with a good story then give a formal definition. 2. Each topic takes few sets of questions and completes a short time that encourages you to learn more topics. 3. It is your brain exercise and you can test how good you are in concepts. 4. It helps you to reflect on topics you already know. It sparks your mind by showing a practical problem and then solving it to explain the topic. You then ponder upon the topic from new perspective. 5. Attractive UI and UX.,5
"The math contents on Brillant is legit, it is fun, thought provoking and intuitive. Content wise I gave it highest rating possible. I also paid for monthly subscription and it is worth every penny. If you do not want to pay you can enjoy daily quizes which is free, you can try that and a few first lessons in each courses for a while and see whether this is right for you. Please note that I never contact their support for anything so my rating does not reflect their customer support.",5
I like the user interface and the animations I really needed something to help me to get through college. Brilliant is great but for someone not that smart like me it was hard. It is a little more advanced even the foundation bits. But I strongly recommend it especially for computer science students or professionals.,5
"Jumps through difficult topics very quickly without giving you an opportunity to practice the skills that you learn. There are questions but if you get them wrong you continue on with the course anyway whether you understand or not. It makes it hard to motivate yourself to get your money's worth. Very expensive for what it is. For me, I'll just go back to the textbook.",2
"I signed up/paid for this course unaware of how the company cons you. I started a refresher in Algebra. First few problems were indeed helpful but then suddenly the curriculum changed to advanced topics that had not been covered which were not solvable for me due to no explanation. I sent not one but TWO emails to the company requesting assistance or at a minimum, an explanation so I could continue learning but it's been more than a month and no response whatsoever. Avoid! Scam! Zero stars",1
"The course is simple, but it's nearly identical to a few other free courses I've seen at khan academy, despite that, if you forget to cancel the premium, you're automatically charged the annual fee (nearly $200). Do NOT download if you don't plan on sticking around for more than a few months.",1
Could you please: 1. Allow page flipping only from the margins if the page? Otherwise it's hard to scroll some horizontal formulas that appear on the page. 2. Please allow zooming of the page. Sometimes it gets too small to read on a mobile phone. 3. Why did you change the colors and layout? The former one was better!,4
"Many of the answers to puzzles were just wrong. E mailed to them detailed explanations. Never got a reply, or some explanation back. I guess people who code the app, and people who make quizzes do not like each other and never communicate. Also don't expect to learn anything serious unless you are willing to pay, and pay US rates as well, just converted to local currency. No regional pricing and poor support. Recipie for *not success*",2
"Brilliant is brilliant! I absolutely love this app. I study astrophysics and have used brilliant during the course of my degree and to keep me sharp during none term times. Not only are the topics well designed and build your knowledge up in manageable chunks, but the inclusion of ""streaks"" and ""leagues"" taps into my competitive side which brings me back to Brilliant every day 👌 If your passionate about learning and want to develop new skills then Brilliant is truly a worth while investment!",5
"An interesting service but not suited to being a phone app. The questions they ask almost always require a pen and paper, or a calculator, or Excel, so it's not just something you can do in the palm of your hand like Duolingo or Codecademy. And as far as I can tell there's no... teaching? just a bunch of puzzles if you already know the stuff. Wouldn't recommend and DEFINITELY wouldn't pay the absurd yearly price, just buy a used textbook.",1
There is no unsubscribe button on manage my subscription. I tried to delete my account only to be landed with an error. According to their terms I should be able to cancel my subscription but was charged due to reasons above. No response from the support team and the only way you can get to them is via email. I have sent few request emails requesting a repayment and cancellation and none of them were responded to not even an acknowledgement email. I am thinking of raising a dispute with my bank.,1
"The app comes with a hefty price, and it doesn't stand up to it. The sentences in the readings are not well structured. There is a great deal of information out there, but without a clear and easy language, everything seems useless. There have been instances where I found myself reading an explanation thrice and still not understanding what they were trying to convey, only to end up finding it not properly structured. These kind of experiences are very frustrating. Please use simple language.",2
Exceptional app for brain training and understandind matchs and physics,5
Very good and fun for education of all ages,5
"From experience, the introductory lessons were quite challenging and amazing for a free state of the app. But the introductory are just short version of basically an ad for the whole app. It is so limited to the point that some of it are just repetitive. For an app that promote science and math this app is way to expensive.",3
"Content is good but often assumes prior knowledge. It tends to asks questions first then offer explanations rather than explain first and then test to see if the user has understood. That can be useful but won't appeal to all, and some users may be put off by getting lots of wrong answers where things haven't been explained yet. Another criticism is the ""fiddliness"" in navigation. It's not always possible to get back to the main screen and the back button just takes you out of the app.",3
I really like this app. It's like a teacher without condenscending attitude and/or questionable intentions. It made me rediscover the joy of the learning process which i have lost during high school. Finally the only one i have to compete against is my own. Just as it should be. I will enter subscription once my financial status is getting better. Great APP for people who like universal knowledge that can be applied in many useful ways.,5
"This learning app will give every user a wonderful experience on learning math, science, and technology in such a way that it would make you feel like you are just playing while learning, and not regurgitating forcefully the knowledge. I would definitely recommend this app to everybody who loves to learn new things and to everyone who wants to learn math, science, and technology in a way that it won't torture your brain to understand the lesson, because they make it fun and interesting to learn",5
"The app has forgot my progress in all courses. This is connected directly with migration to the new layout, as whenever it happens I can get my progress back by navigating to the URL of the old version of the course. The support mailed me back that they are aware and are working on the fix, but nothing changes after months.",1
"Awful optimization. Some links referring to build-in wiki don't work. Very poor working offline-system. Courses don't provide deep understanding of topic (I tried only ""blue"" ones, and followed all requirements). Small amount of exercises, and most of them are hidden in wiki-pages instead of lessons. And all of this costs too much for some countries (please, check out Steam's pricing system for different regions). UPD: but still, idea is great. Please, develop this app and listen your users",3
"This app has been brilliant, especially for understanding things visually. It would be great to add functional maths to the courses and even a screen reader in the app as sometimes reading the information can be hard to understand. I look forward to using this app more often for other subjects",4
"Great application, with great courses and explanations. All the features strung together with the catalyst of its intuitive design, however the premium is too expensive. As a learning application it's fantastic in the leagues of Khan academy and Duolingo. However if your a student, trying to refine your skills, paying a subscription priced akin to most streaming services isn't practical when you already own and have access to resources that although aren't as refined are just as serviceable.",2
"Content & Pedagogic philosophy is top notch. Quizzes cover a wide range of accessablity and challenge and explanations are well fleshed out. I got it to get into CS and was very pleased with the analogies used in there CS fundamentals course. The platform is missing out on an engineering tab. The app could push the use of touch screens in their puzzles. In short, definitely worth the price if you intend to get into CS and physics.",5
"Interesting and useful courses, lots of them. Great feature - free daily challenges. Unfortunately last feature was broken somewhere in last few months, and I'm not able to access previous days. Today's solution is not marked as done. Uninstalled app because it was main feature I used, but still would recommend this app as really good educational application, definitely among the best worldwide.",4
"Obnoxious process to cancel the subscription! I had to click on ""cancel plan"" about times(not even Amazon, arguably one of the worst companies in the world has you click on cancel more than 3x) - had to scroll through 100 pages of content, so i can see ""what i ll be missing out on"" - Reminding me that i will pay way more if i decide to reactivat my subscription - Reminding me yet again about the amazing content i ll miss out on - and propably a few more i forgot. Manipulative & Exploitative",1
"I picked the app back up wondering why i stopped, then I realised why while starting the logic portion, i thought ""hmm this looks familiar"", they give you clues to move ty, rae, lex and Marv to the correct positions, I did it and told me I was wrong, then after scratching my head for a good 10 minutes or so I clicked to reveal the answer, it was the exact one I did. Don't get me wrong I think the app is great, but I installed it to learn more not to be gaslighted.",3
"EDIT: Changed again from 4 to 2 stars. I cannot recommend this app anymore. Theory is all fun and games but when the company behind Brilliant can't maintain their app property and it is so breaking that some puzzles can't be solved or images related to them doesn't show, it is simply embarrassing. I feel sorry for the team of mathematicians that create the puzzles to be paired with such incompetent software development teams. Sad, because the thought behind it is fantastic.",2
"I've given again five stars, for I've disinstalled and reinstalled the app and now it seeems to work properly Old post: (Sorry guys, I really love Brilliant, but in the app recently happened that each progress that I do in courses from a certain point are not traced: whenever I close the app and reopen it, they will reset like that I haven't done them ...)",5
"Hi, I just bouggt the premiim version but the app keeps crashing the whole day today.",1
"Brilliant is the best game ever! I love subjects like math, physics, and computer science!",5
A good way to improve on your cognition and problem solving skills....,5
"Something useful to do while you poop, or in transit. Better than doom scrolling without a doubt👍",5
Brilliant is the best educational app I learn new existing and interesting things everyday. I rated it 4 instead of 5 because I am not able to do online payment(for some reasons)and I think there are other people who are also like me so If there was one good concept of earning points by solving questions in brilliant and then we can use those points to unlock premium subscription for a month or a week If that can be done then it will be most useful For students like me in the world,4
"Easy learning , I like this app it's a breaze getting through the lessons.",5
Great app but Duolingo is better when it comes to the free experience.,4
I love how very illustrative equations are made for a great experience and understanding,5
"Whether your professional, students, or just have enthusiasm with Math and Science, Brilliant is just at your side with wide array selection of different courses ranging from Computer Science, Programming, Complex Algebra, Calculus, and Physics, etc. This tackles all the concepts about the field with the help of vibrant community, learning has never been easy, enjoying, and fun with the mobility of their app.",5
"I can't fairly rate it. The initial experience was good, it seemed like they had a rough idea what they were doing at first, as I was setting up my account I felt like they genuinely wanted to help, I didn't make it past the account creation however as the app then gets you to sign up for a 7 day trial then immediately expects you to pay 225$ for a full year subscription. No thanks.",3
"Really great I recommend using this app, they offer great things for the premium version. Great app!",5
Easy and accesible way to review engineering content and principles.,5
"Great service to learn, build upon or recover math skills.",4
Very streamlined and has a great method on teaching.,5
"Please add dark mode in the app, though overall experience is nice.",5
Great app. But can you guys add economics courses as well?,5
canceled on my last day of free trial and they still charged me $150 !! not happy,1
"Pretty efficient way of learning, the visual way",5
Very good explanations. I've learned a lot! This is a 5-Star program.,5
"The app is great, and the content is excellent. Why am I giving it two stars then? It's ridiculously expensive!!!. I'm a student from a Third world country, I can't afford to pay 24 monthly dollars (let alone a yearly subscription of 149 dollars in a single month). I can understand the need of having some kind of revenue and I'm all up for it, but there's not even regional prices and you can tell they didn't consider countries outside NA. It's very dissapointing.",1
"My daughter is year 7, she is first in her class at maths, because of brilliant.",5
"The content is great and absolutely worth a subscription... but subscribers should absolutely get to have the ability to download courses offline but they dont , that and the app being frustrating to use sometimes (scrolling is a chore and just how tapping works is poorly done) so thats why i can only give it 3 stars Improving the UI and offline use are each worth one star to me , if they implement either , I will change my review",3
"Doesn't load, charged $18,000 USD to my credit card. Watch out.",1
It makes me very smart and I didn't see any errors or things that make you confused,5
4 stars - Don't like the fact that I have to pay for some stuff but it is good ~ 2016/03/17 Now this is just a cash grab. basically nothing I can do without paying. not even the daily challenges!!!! ~ 2020/04/26 The daily challenges are also so bad and have very little to do with maths. 2016 was much better becuase there were more daily challenges and also it was actually about maths. ~ 2020/06/03,1
CAREFUL ON THE FREE SUBSCRIPTION! IF YOU DONT CANCEL IN TIME THEY WILL CHARGE YOU $128 FOR A FULL YEAR INSTEAD OF JUST CHARGING YOU FOR A MONTH! VERY MALICIOUS PRACTICES BY THIS COMPANY!,1
"Helping relearn math, great app, easy to use.",5
Works like a charm. Having fun with the coding,5
I bought premium for a year at an advertised discount. Got charged full price and 12hours later I still cannot access premium content. My card has been charged and all that so not sure where to go next. I contacted support and am happy to revisit my rating after the situation is resolved. Pity as the free features made up to be promising enough for wanting to spend 67eurs (or 85 seeing I got charged full price lol 🙈),1
"this app is a helpful tool to learn science and maths. the format is well-chosen so if you don't know anything about a subject, you'll get all the information you need to approach a given problem. if you like challenges as well, there's more than enough to go with. I bought the premium version quickly after trying it out because i think an investment in this type of learning app is a good choice.",5
"I'm really learning complex subjects with the aid of an interactive app. That's novel to me. Their non passive approach to learning and letting the user to also discover things on the go is really well done, I'm really glad that I've found this app. There's been a few years since I've finished college, but now I'm taking the time to understand everything I need to do my work as a game developer at an intuitive level, highly recommended to those who want to go beyond using libraries",5
"A totally awesome app full of fun and learning. A unique opportunity to visualise the chapters, concepts in the world around us. Kudos to the creator of brilliant app. I am really enjoying this wonderful journey of learning and it is helping me also to make my concepts fully clear. Once again thank you for this wonderful experience.",5
Best app for learning o wish tehre wore more of these apps on the playstore rather than what we have now. Also I'm a premium member and in the einsteinium league. Please intorduce more leagues after einsteinium as competition plays a very major role in keeping us motivated towards learning more ad each day. Also we can memeorise the elements of the periodic table this way lol. Another request is to keep adding more courses and also if possible bring back the retired courses too. Thank you.,5
"I love this app and I've been using it for years and bought the premium version for the last couple of years, but I'm editing my review and changing the rating because I've noticed a few typos and things to improve which would still be fine if only there was a way to report the stuff when I find it. Old courses used to have the report option (e.g. Logic 2020)— I can't find a similar option in the new Logic course, though.",3
"Glad I didn't buy ,the courses seem fine but the app is very buggy, half of the exercises are impossible to complete because you can't type in the answers or when you do it says you wrote them in incorrectly. Quite ridiculous for such a price tag. Almost seems as if there was no quality control. Hire some testers or something . Will revisit if updated.",1
"Hi! The Brilliant app to get my brain to rest but keeping it active some of the time. In fact, as a college student I my brain is too active when studying but with Brilliant I rest up my mind without lowering my cognitive skills . That's why I recommend this app for all college students!",5
High quality and fun to learn with. It's not a complete pack of each kind of subjects but it is the best and enough for a person like me that currently learning math and science as my passion and hobby!! It even has logic games and problem solving game which is my favorite!! You should add more chapter for each subjects in the future:).,5
I am still waiting for any response from you. It's been 3 weeks. I have also made a refund request which has not been entertained until now.,1
Really nice range of options and explanations,5
"Amazing app, it really helps me understand topics that I have ling struggle with. One thing I wish this app has is a monthly plan. That and one suggestion is to make completing task more fun by adding achievements or giving some sort of points that you can spend for something, like customization for your avatar for example.",5
"Concepts are explained in a much clearer and sequential way compared to most textbooks and videos. I'm interested in the science content but I would be happy to look into the other topics. It would be great if there were more modules on chemistry and biology, otherwise it is well worth the subscription fee.",5
Amazing app for learning and solidifying concepts.,5
"It's probably a good app, but since they offer only a paid subscription with opt-out, I canceled the registration process. Still, they kept my data and keep sending me advertising emails, I never approved. Deleting the account is also hidden and needs a password, even though I am signed in with my Google account and therefore don't have a password with Brilliant. I can only recommend this if you are willing going through a lot of hassle if you don't want to pay.",2
"The app is great! It's nice to use brilliant app, which gives a good job of the info size of the courses and daily questions. Even though that in phones which have a small screen it would be a little unfit, everything is great. Thanks for brilliant I answer offline courses and daily questions from everywhere in comfort.",5
"Good app for understanding complex things, improving habits and learning math, programming and phsyics. As a robotics, student, who had no previous experience and very low skills in programming, math and physics, this helps me a lot. I suggest deleting social media and downloading this.",5
"It's not bad, but I had to try figure out what the math symbols mean and how things like square root and exponents work on Mt own. I haven't seen the benefit over just learning from a book yet. At least they explain everything in the book.",3
"Very well made app to keep yourself trained in a lot of different topics, math, calculus, science, logic, programming, etc But the monthly price is INSANE for my country standards, please make it more affordable",4
What a fun app!!! I never have a moment of boredom anymore. Even waiting in line somewhere I can run through a quick lesson or even a fraction of a lesson.,5
"I have the yearly subscription and then I learn that you can't save your courses offline, so now I am locked in their interface, cant recommend it without the offline feature",1
Great app for as much as I hate to admit it. Though I'd honestly like it more if they just had an ad for every wrong answer instead of the amount they ask,4
I literally love your app but 1)only 4 lessons per course ahh😕 Please increase that and 2)if possible add a dark mode and a streak widget and notification for saving streak it really helps,5
"i use the app on a pixel 6a. i like the idea of the app, but i encountered a lot performances issues like anr or freezing.",3
"Honestly, we need more apps and websites designed like this. Also, if you incorporate AI with this type of style of learning, it can be really good!",5
"Excellent so far, but think I will run out of computer courses pretty quickly. Learning experience and practice is ace though.",5
"Fun learning experience to remind you of basics and to learn alot of new stuff, only problem is trying to pace myself so I don't run out of stuff to learn",5
It's got laser focus on the essentials. I have more confidence learning from this app than any textbook.,5
"It doesn't get easier than this. The motivation of the League, the walkthrough of each lesson is smooth.",5
"App will not start lessons. Crashes every time. It's a real shame because this, in theory would be perfect for me.",1
"Each screen needs Internet connection, so you can't use it on commute on London tube, for example.",2
Careful - you only get a certain amount of modules before you have to pay and then Brilliant will bombard you with reminder and marketing emails.,2
"it's a supper simple visual set up so I dont get confused, and every problem as a visual example whitch is perfet for me.",5
nice app i like it most but i i have 1 problem can we have more option multiple time like while opt cs its showing cs only i want more options like physics and all it would be great....,5
"Very well tailored math content, I know just every day math and with this app I'm understanding more complex things with a simple explanation.",5
"This app is so cool it helped me learn many different things about science, coding and many other. It is very fun and easy to use also",5
"When I try to start a lesson the animation of the shapes moving around kills 5% of my battery and then it says ""Unable to start lesson"".",1
"This is a great app but there are som bugs which really need addressing. Today's daily challenge, for example, doesn't render the sums for each section correctly - a UI bug. Similarly it's a frustrating experience where completing a daily challenge is never logged and no streaks are kept to keep myself motivated.",4
i have done a few daily quizes and one course on solar radiation. It has been a while since I did summations and fractals and it has been a very nice learning curve to get back in the saddle. tired of internet and facebook and just feeling like life ia boring? revive you study side with anything from math to science to logic. really cool small daily challenges. so really nice.,5
"I want a much cleaner interface, this is messy. And a lot of small stuff that doesn't bode well for the rest of the user experience. Didn't really try it, seemed difficult to find the level I want to challenge myself at. The design is very white and boring. Like the textbooks they aim to be an alternative to?",3
"This app has worked great for me. It is as good as it looks. I've always liked math and this allows me to practice and learn more in a better, more efficient and actually fun way. It goes from high school courses all they way up to university level courses. And it includes fun little curses as well, like probably for casino games. Very practical and also fun.",5
[Dark Mood] pls I would give it 5 stars but the white background burning my eyes please make a dark mood to it I can't use it comfortably,4
"It's super good, but so expensive... Yes I live in Switzerland but I'm just a temp scholar. And even for Switzerland 25 CHF per month for an app!? Are u insane 😅 and with all the complains on the comments about issues with their subscription is really not giving any trust. Such a shame. At least make some alternative subscription options...",3
"Just the right thing for my BRAIN DEVELOPMENT and knowledge in Math,Science and Tech. Though this app is more focused on LOGIC based programs,I would like it better if it incorporated some memory training stuff too. Still,even without it,the app is one of a kind. Perfect Inteface and everything. Just amazing.",5
"An excellent program. BUT free content is minimal. Subscription to ""Premium"" is prohibitively expensive if you need to spread payments (two and a half times more expensive than if you can afford to pay in one payment) which discriminates against people on a low / fixed income.",3
"Very good app to learn more in math and science. As a Mechanical Egineer, I would have given it five starts, but there is still room to improve, it could have been better if there were videos explaining how things work, or just even an audio to loosen up, especially in the science field, to make it more engaging.",4
Very interesting app it helps you learn through actual problems,5
"Suggested improvements: - changing the offline courses without waiting for the current ones to expire - getting a chance to reattempt quizzes (maybe a week after one failed them) - choosing between the old and new design (the 1960s have called, they want the current design back...) - more advanced courses - I would love to give feedback on individual slides, however I can only rate the helpfulness of solutions and rate entire chapters",2
"App is unreliable. Right now I can't even start a lesson, it never finishes loading and no troubleshooting helps. Tapping the support email link causes the app to crash. I'm probably gonna lose my streak but at least it's not that long. Maybe add some streak repair feature like in DuoLingo? I'm now regretting getting the annual subscription. Edit: The issue fixed itself after 15 minutes.",3
"I like the app and the games. After the introductions you need to subscribe. I'd generally be willing to pay for it but there seems to be only a yearly option, which is a too big commitment and too large a payment for me to come out of my account all at once. I'd subscribe if there was a monthly option.",3
"They Team Brilliant, I've just started using this and i was playing with some tutorials and v beginning level, I've noticed you've got a great learning source for all ages but your extra information pops can be distracting/confusing and it can try to show a little appreciating for good gusses atleast. Or maybe try not asking trick question if you do give a thumbs up or hight something. 👻 cheers",5
"The lessons and methods to teach are brilliant, really: it's colorful, really explained... I admire that, but the downhill is that you can't move on to the next level or lesson without Premium. It sucks like that.",3
"I paid for a yearly subscription, $195 AUD, one month later was charged for another year subscription of $195, I have since asked for a refund but never got it. Some people might have had better experiences but in my eyes they will always be scammers.",1
Love it! Sometimes it's hard to wrap my mind around concepts that are new to me but I let it sink and get back. I like that there is no pressure and I'm free to dig into the subject at my own pace. This app is just what I needed after giving up on math in school 💖 Interest regained and I look forward to every day I schedule to work on a couple of chapters. Every penny (in my case it's kopiyky) worth it! BTW! Look out for auto-charging! Didn't happen thx to my empty card. Payed after trial,4
"The latex loads so slowly and there's no option to add a solution. And, I don't get any user notification! The website works much better – I'd just prefer to add a shortcut to the site at home screen for quick navigation. Still, 5 stars for the awesome problems and courses!",5
"Good app but the trial version is quite limited and the paid version is prohibitively expensive. £17.50/month prices the vast majority of people out, which is a shame. I can only assume they did their market research to set the price point only using people that work in Silicon Valley. People that live in the real world don't have that kind of money to fritter away on an app. Netflix is £6/month, Amazon Prime is £8/month. £17.50/month is a ridiculous price point. Rethink it and I'd sign up.",3
It's too hard. Like learning curve goes way up pretty fast for most of courses. Maybe this is made for highschool grads or sonybut if you want to really start from basics then Khan Academy does it way better and completely free while I paid 100 EUR for this and meh..,2
"Knowledge is human rights and therefore must be available for free (or affordable price). I believe that me and many others user agree as well to that point. Please add different price plan to accomodate various demographic background & income across the world (or made different approach like: ads based service). Or add scholarship program to access the full content. Heck, even buying encyclopaedia/books didn't cost that much.",3
"Absolutely deserve the 5* rating!! Best educational and self improvement app. I've got to know about this app from Mr Whose the Boss channel but oh boy, this app really delivers what's expected. Spectacular app for overall development if you can go for Premium!! Free contents are also good enough to keep you hooked into it. It's got each and every topic to suit one's needs. More importantly no annoying ads in free mode! Highly recommended. Have a try once!",5
more than half of the content is retired and more are retiring,1
"So I paid for the premium version of the app but unfortunately I could not access the course contents. When I click to start, it brings me back to the same interface. I want this bug to be fixed immediately please. Thanks. Once that is done and I have accessed the contents and see that it's worth the fees, I will come back here to review my rate and be more positive with my review. Until then, I await immediate fix.",1
"I haven't used it that much yet but I'm already impressed with the content of its courses. They guide one through the content in a fun and yet fairly thorough way. I can only recommend this, even only for the free content. Furthermore, the app is overall very user firendly.",5
"I was really overwhelmed by using this app for learning. I was using it for free. But when I realised that I could not go further lessons in order to pay them my heart was broken. You have just to stop at the beginning. You can never finish a course for free. So, if you're intended to use this app for free then don't download it because you have to stop at the beginning.",1
"I really needed a quick way to review and learn some concepts just to get an overview. I tried online courses, and they are just too much work. I never finish. The courses on Brilliant are fun and interactive and in bite-size pieces. I finally understand what hypothesis testing is!",5
"Great app. I always prefer it for learning. Thecway it helps in learning and understanding concepts is great. I'm fan of this. I would suggest some couses included Data Science, ML , AI and Algorithms should be added. Thanks. It's Brilliant.",5
"This app is a dream come to life and is just incredible to use, BUT I am not an adult and have no way to pay the fee for premium, which is intergrel to actually using the app, so I wish Brilliant could work on a donation system or even just have some of the beginner courses full unlocked for free use. I love Brilliant but I don't think I can use it until I acquire the means of payment for premium, which, in my opinion, is too harsh for free users",5
"5 stars - amazing app! The puzzles are challenging but the explanations are always helpful. It makes learning fun. The developers are very quick to respond to feedback and fix bugs, which are incredibly rare to begin with. Worth the price if you're serious about learning more about maths, science and computers",5
"Brilliant is well-suited as a supplement to students' school learning, but it is even better for STEM enthusiasts looking to improve their analytical and judgemental skills and intuition. The well-structured approach makes the application suited for enthusiasts with different levels of proficiency in their area of interest. I feel the ""annual plan"" prices are reasonable. Brilliant is to me a manifestation of the idea that learning is a journey and not a destination.",5
I'm 56 years old. Wanted something challenging to work on. Always liked maths and science. Love this. What a great way to pass an hour and learn.,5
Brilliant app (puns intended) it is an awesome experience learning from this it teaches us the relevance of mathematical theories in real life but I have an issue that the continue and show explanation buttons are kind of glitchy they dont work in a single tap they need to be repeatedly tapped until it happens which is kind of annoying but not a big problem,5
It truly is what it advertises as. Learning while being fun and interactive and each lesson is small so my small brain can understand it and not get bored. The only thing that I ever questioned is whether the subscription is worth it or not. Short answer - definitely worth it.,5
Subscription is everything. No subscription no learning,1
"Most of the stuff I went through so far has cumbersome explanations and feels painful to go through. I feel that the UI and the structuring itself is a good idea but whoever wrote the actual texts failed to deliver a meaningful educative value. It's easier to just google whatever topic you want to learn about and shift through all available materials until you find one that you can connect with and absorb, rather than get this on-the-rail back-in-school experience.",2
"Grade A app, its always hard finding fun ways to learn. This app provides a pretty good breakdown when you make mistakes and highlights what thing should be. The help/support is also very good.",5
As someone with dyslexia coming back to maths in my mid thirties I was disappointed at the sometimes confusing explanations in the way the questions were asked. Maybe it's just me but I found the app made assumptions that once you had been told a concept once then you should have it locked in your brain. There is promise here but I wouldn't recommend it as it is.,3
"This app is fun and has many useful features that school learners find usefull. Although the application has proved its usefulness, it's contrasted by the prices the developers put on certain features. This application is targeted at school children, so I'm disgusted when I see the game monopolizing in learners who just want to learn. The simple alternative is to add ads before the application is opened.",3
The course about exploring data visually felt like a paid advertisement for Airbnb. It would have been interesting to learn about how Airbnb drives up the cost of (non airbnb) rent and property value instead.,1
"It's a great app, it would be better if the app is more interactive. Currently, the app is DIY style. It feels tedious and repetitive. I'm learning as a hobby and I'm not really enjoying it. Apart from brilliant, I like watching documentarys, Youtube channels like ReallifeLore make it so much easier to get an idea of things. Hes narration style hooks the audiance. Brilliant is a great app, but I feel like I'm preparing for an Exam.",3
"Used to be excellent, but has gone downhill since I last used it. Constant crashing, not always available and the syllabus seems to have changed. Also the daily puzzles are if not removed then hidden to the point of being as good as removed. I sort of regret subscribing, which isn't a great endorsement.",3
"Brilliant is an excellent app for learning math, physics, science, and programming etc. It's super user-friendly and makes complex topics easy and enjoyable. The interactive puzzles and courses are engaging and perfect for all skill levels. Highly recommend for anyone looking to boost their problem-solving skills! 🌟💡📚",5
"Oh, I thought you were joking about 12 hours to try free premium. Oh well, looks like I'll never be able to try out your service and won't even think about paying 🤷‍♀️",1
A app to practice or train your brain on the daily. The daily practices really does improve cognitive response & problem solving.,5
"I guess this is the best brain training app ever! The problems are hard, but the solutions are fairly easy, this proves that we need to work on our rusty brains and think our way out of the problems and life as a whole. The courses and their range is brilliant. Overall, the best app according to me!",5
"Glad I didn't give them my money. Subscribing method is scammy. Too many negative reviews. Trial showed me nothing to learn, but plenty to pay for. The courses are so simplistic. The app bugs out (hangs), courses don't load. Teaching method sucks: here's a problem can you solve it? No? Well here's the solution. And here's the explanation (bad explanation). No dark mode. Bye bye brilliant.",1
"My evaluation is only about the app, not the courses/quizzes. Got the app mainly for offline usage. The app works worst than the website, often it doesn't not sync well with the progresses made. The main problem is indeed the offline mode: half of the time doesn't work, got 3 hours flight but couldn't do any lesson, the app kept crashing while trying to open the downloaded course.",1
A perfect app for stem concept building. It provides more important to visual learning rather than just memmorizing concepts. But my suggestion is you have to arrange the questions and in quizes in a way that the difficulty of the question should gradually increase. That means from easy concepts to complicated ones.also include some more exercising portions to master the concepts.But i appreciate your effort to ptovide such animations and illustrations.,5
"This app it's dream come true. Thanks for the briliant ideal. I've been trying to reach you. I even sent you an email, but received no response. Why? And I don't understand why there is no notification when someone subscribes - whether it was successful or not. Please, I mistakenly made a yearly subscription instead of a monthly subscription. Can you please refund me?.",5
"I really like the way I'm learning with Brilliant. It's fun and entertaining. My only issue so far is that whenever I use the app, my progress doesn't get recorded, so I have to start over using the computer browser. This limits the time I can use the app. If anybody knows anyway I can fix this it would really help me.",4
"I am an Actuary and I have also studied Math at a Masters level. I was shocked to find that I was learning something new with every quiz of even the most basic math courses, such as in Mathematics foundations and Pre-Algebra (which I was doing because I'm a completionist). I think the fact that I'm not bored and learning even when going through stuff I've mastered over a decade ago speaks volumes for how Brilliant 😏 this app is.",5
"Miss advertising, says one price on app store then charge what they want after the trial period. Explanation on app FAQ that they change the price for various reasons, how is this legal? Absolutely didn't clear up, the issue. Said it was because of added VAT and changes in price structure which if that is the case it should be advertised as so. Theft and lies!",1
"It's BRILLIANT app. It gives incredible questions its theme is nice and standard it provides courses. It gives me those questions for which i dream ... It don't show ads . -,`But`,- it shoud have facility for saving or bookmarking the problem. And whole content should be free... do it for us ... Do some charity free this whole app.. Please",5
"App not for people how knows thing or two about those subjects and not for people how truly want to learn and remember those subjects. Some questions are so simplified that you are wrong if you give truly correct answer based on your knowledge. Also this seems to be waste of time because there is no repetition system, so you will forget about what you just learned. Mostly text (with errors) with some images sometimes some animations and ineteractive elemets, no videos, no lectors",1
"I have a huge problem with the back button. I am expecting it to undo my last action, I.e. undo my amswer on a problem. Instead I am exiting the lesson. I believe it would be more intuitive if it went to the previous problem (and undo any progress) and double tap would make it exit the lesson",4
"The user interface is easy to navigate, making it accessible for users of all ages and skill levels. The courses offered are highly informative and cover their respective topics comprehensively. Additionally, the range of subjects available is extensive and diverse, ensuring that there is something for everyone. Overall, Brilliant provides a good and engaging learning experience.",4
"Python 3 is totally useless in the app. Maybe 10% of the time it actually shows the results of the code even for basic 2 lines of code. Impossible to use through the lessons. Quicker to find the answer by reading the code and no visual aid. Very unimpressed for an app I've paid so much for. Please fix python in the app, I'm on a Samsung Galaxy S9+.",1
"Simply... brilliant. A non-game yet activates the fun centre of the brain. Learning as learning should be! A workout for the intuitive, puzzle-solving brain, with clear well-written explanations. Seriously considering buying the extension pack. But still have plenty to complete for free. Stupendous app!! Good job!!!!!",5
To learn and stay updated is a boon and necessity in times like today. Brilliant is doing an amazing job by providing great content and having a way to help one absorb it in a manner that's interesting and subjective at the same time. I am looking forward to learn more and have more content uploaded by them.,5
Brilliant has a horrible way of explaining math topics. It is worse than my textbook somehow. I had high hopes but the content is just lazy. Nothing is explained well. Do yourself a favor and just use youtube to learn these topics. It is free and you'll find easy to understand explanations to topics that brilliant would never be able to come up with.,1
"The new update removed all the good contents. The entire Algebra I, II , complex numbers and many other sections are completely gone. It used to be a brilliant app with lots of content but it now serve as a preview of all topics. A great disappointment after 2 years of being a user. Immediate unsubscription.",1
I really enjoy the app. It's visually appealing and the explanations are extremely easy to understand. The only problem I have is it's expensive. (Maybe it's just me I am a broke teenager..) If you have the funds to afford it and are interested in expanding your knowledge I definitely recommend it. And the payments are year round so it's really not that bad.,5
"In all my math learning experience I've never seen nothing like this app. The intuitive models, the challenges... It all just fits perfectly to the pace of gaining knowledge on abstract matters such as math and physics. The problem is just the price. Living in a country of cheap currency turns impossible to meet this price in dollars...",4
The courses are well made and intuitive but most of the courses seem to be maths and problem solving oriented rather than physics oriented. Which is unfortunate for me because I was looking to broaden my physics knowledge - you can still do this just lesser so than I was expecting.,4
Everything is absolutely perfect and i think this type of eduaction app is privoking critical thinking in students breaking the boundaries of previously monotonous classroom curriculam. Also it is helping to solidify a concepts about a particular subject .If app could accompany any accompany a quiz with timer to improve in competitive exam or it can provide such scenario then it will be helpful and great,5
An interactive app to learn essential skills in the field of STEM. I would highly recommend anyone to download and start your journey. I would recommend to get the payed subscription and look for promos where ever you can. Payed version is worth your money.,5
"Too be honest when I saw people talk about brilliant, I thought I'll learn a ton math, more than other services like khan academy, Paul's online notes, openstax, which are free. But no, if you just want to learn something just because, sure try it, but if want to master it, don't get it. I could of spent 5 months learning something on other services.",2
"The content is good, but only scratch the serface. Skip the app if you are not an ABSOLUTE beginner. The interface is not optimized for phones at all: keyboard overlaps IDE and tasks, and using app is inconvenient. Also, tasks and explanations are not always clear.",3
"Filled with confusing errors. There's typos all over the logic course, of all places. Making me second guess my sound logic and stressing me out when it's suppose to be teaching me. If only they could apply the skills they're trying to teach in order to properly proofread their questions, answers, and explaination. That would be nice considering I paid over $100 for one year.",3
The context is good but frequently the app hangs,5
I just wish they had a dark mode because I want to do it without hurting my eyes,3
This has been a great app so far. Everything that I expected and exactly as advertised. It is a great brain exercise and has a very organic growing process for the users to ensure that tackle the right challenge as they progressively increase their logic skills. The premium price is a little high but I'm considering the purchase. Keep the good work!,5
An amazing app to learn math. But it only offers around 12 lessons and after that u have to pay(i think its worth the money),4
"I like it only because the way they teach is pretty much how i usually learn best anyway. I've learned more through hands on and figuring stuff out than i have from a classroom. However, if your a person who prefers to learn the information before you get tested on it, then this isn't for you.",5
"Too goofy and game-like. I don't care about useless ""points earned"" and the associated arbitrary progression alerts constantly interrupting my progress. I just wanted to learn, but it treats you like a child who needs constant encouragement to even go from one step to another.",2
"I have adhd and thought that I couldn't learn properly, but this app us tremendously helpful, every time I am wrong it explains why I'm wrong, every time I'm right it gives me a positive feedback, basically gives me direct consequences to what I'm doing without making me feel bad about it, also it is more like based in visuals which helps me understand it better, this app showed me that I like learning and makes it a game wich makes it fun",5
"The first thing I'd like to say is that the app itself is excellent in concept. My negative review comes from my experience of the staffs inability to teach (So far). A lot of the solutions so far seem to be missing critical information. For someone who has been doing this stuff as long as them, I suppose it's just common sense. But their intended audience is people who are new to these subjects or who lack this knowledge, and the explanations for the solutions regularly don't provide that information. They clearly care about their users, because they always respond to any tickets you send in, but when it comes to teaching, they lack awareness of those less experienced than they are.",2
"Unfortunately some more advanced courses are made just for title. Formal sentences, unclear explanations and lack of examples. Moreover, the app sometimes hangs and becomes unresponsive. However, on the bright side, there are engaging and very informative cources for beginners.",3
"This app sent me on a trip through the world od artificial intelligence. I learned more in the last 3 days than the entire intro to AI course i took at University. although i bet the difference is that i pay way more attention to brilliant than i did in class thats the beauty of this app. Its presents knowledge in a way that's keeps you curious and makes you want to learn. well worth the subscription so far, and im only 3 days in. quite incredible",5
"Loving the ability to try out multiple courses. Perfect for people who enjoy expanding their mind in a way that allows you to make intellectual gains, expand your knowledge and supplement your common sense. I plan on purchasing full version when i have time to dedicate to the app, as i feel this is one that won't be a waste of time!",5
You're aiming for simplicity but you're using vocabulary from a university. Use simpler words or at least add description to these smarty words.,1
"Fantastic app. I felt like I was in a rut, but this helped me explode out of it.",5
"I signed up for premium with a year subscription. Premium content does not work - says i am not a premium member. Checked my credit card - it has been billed. Emailed support twice - no response. Terrible experience, considering that the yearly cost is over a 100$. Updated the app - fixed the premium bug. Giving it 2 🌟, for having 4 days of zero communication and nothing working after sign up.",2
I downloaded this app from recommandations from lot of educational and animated videos on youtube . I am thankful to them it's probably the most productive and useful app I have ever used. It starts from a very basic level and goes higher and higher strengthening the concepts. I personally love the animation and the visuals of the app besides the knowledge.,5
"The structure of teaching in this program is slightly off, which often leaves some serious gaps in understanding. For example in the basic calculus course, the first 2 chapters are solely focused on the theory of calculus and learners were asked to ""guess"" the result when, say, we differentiate 4x^2 instead of just teaching us how to differentiate first. The actual mathematical & calculations part only comes quite late into the course, which will leave people really confused at the start.",3
"Good: Often intriguing and well written questions. Simple interface. Bad: Sometimes very poor questions. ""Report"" button doesn't work such that I feel the only way to report a problem is here. An example of a very bad question appeared on my phone today. It stated that oxygen was burned to produce thrust and that the required answer was to be in Newtons but used a possessive apostrophe instead of the plural. It disappoints me that such a poorly edited product is offered for education.",2
Awesome it's incredible like it it's impossible unbelievable I love it just as I wanted,5
"I feel smarter with this app , very good and effective.",5
"It souls be mandatory to disclose the full price of an app on the Play page. This app is $160/year all charged at once. For the absolutely insane price you should have all the bugs worked out. For example, if you press back accidentally you will ex out of a lesson and lose progress. Insane.",3
I like the app's concept but How will I get to know that is the app contains what concepts I want. I suugest that you must provide a free demo for at least 2 weeks so that one can analyse the concept of the app and its working. It almost feels irrelevant to spend 400 per month on subscription if you didnt find something useful in it.,3
"So far the strongest foundation of learning in my own. Courses designed such way that don't need any instructor for explanation. It will be a misunderstanding if you take it as something that automatically feed you the concept of Logic, math, physics and CS. In terms of learning the STEM one must devote and pour the time with persistence. It will work as a super supplement in front of high rated books and trainers. Last of all, only aspiring Problem Solvers should buy and involve with it.",5
"Untrustworthy company. Signed up to a ""free trial"", forgot to cancel the payment for my free trial. Notified them within 3 hours of the payment. They said they'd give me a refund. They lied. PayPal said they denied the refund. However they have removed my premium subscription. So now I've been charged for a year but have no access to what I've paid for. I had planned to eventually subscribe, but not if that is how little they care about their customers. Dishonest company.",1
"I dont know who this app is targeted towards?...the ""games"" are designed to be like mini science and math courses, but there is a tremendous amount of reading and it doesn't give a thorough explanation...if you are learning there isn't enough info, if you are practicing there is way too much reading! Just super frustrating and unenjoyable",2
"Its really god to keep up with studies, a course. The content is well sought and really helpful for people of all ages. Learning becomes easy and well organized. It helps you in any field. It makes learning everlasting and easy. My personal favourite right now.",5
"Great app, very engaging and educational. But the quizzes freeze when I get to the second to last qiestion. I have to close the app and relaunch it to be able to finish each quiz. I hope the developers fox this bug in the next version.",4
"Great way to keep someone learning in bits, as opposed to not at all. I think someone would find it easier to remember their streak with some sort of widget so that they have a visual reminder if their notifications aren't enough.",5
"Wow, thanks for the help!! 🙄 It has helped me no doubt, but when doing the algebra, its helping but not by much. Im actually trying to learn how tl do the eqautions without plugging in multiple choice answers to see if it works. For example. I was given 12/x = 7-x. How many possible solutions. It have multiple choice. 3,4,no solutions and infinite. The answer was 3 and 4. The explaination didnt give you any kind of step by step guide. It literally just plugged in the multiple choice numbers.",4
"Every time my screen turns off, the app takes 2 seconds to sign back in and I have to find where I left off. This is a terrible user experience for some one at the gym who wants to learn in between reps. I checked battery optimization and I made sure this app is unrestricted.",2
"I would love to give this 5 stars. However, win streak and mandatory league features tend to lead me into forming unhealthy relationships with apps that feature them. I understand that a free service is entitled to use whatever engagement-driving tactics they wish. As someone who is paying for premium, though? I know that I'm not alone in saying that I would be much more likely to use your app daily if I didn't have to engage with these features. An option to hide them would be appreciated",2
"Great app for searching for knowledge. I won't be able to continue because the price is high in my country. I just wish they would localize the price for countries where the dollar is expensive, like Brazil which costs 7x more.",5
"I find it interesting that I've never downloaded this app, but this morning, I found a $129.50 charge for a subscription to this bloated, useless, and pointless software in my PayPal account. That would be a scam. And one that I'm intent on exposing and bringing law enforcement to bear on. I would have no reason to even go looking for this kind of application as I am already quite adept at higher forms of mathematics, and am not pursuing computer science. This is a sketchy app. SCAM!",1
I love how affordable the app/website is. I'm not sure but I think I found a new career waiting to hear back from support. I think I found my calling I'm schizophrenic and I find this type of work to be a distraction from the voices. I may not be getting a disability check for much longer. I hope their are still people out there that employ these kinds of people. I'm really excited to be apart of programming.,5
"Brilliant has been great for me in terms of everything, from the friendly interface to hands-on courses. Now it has become rather disoriententedly optimized; in fact, now the system is so similar to Doulingo's",4
"I was enjoying it until it refused to move past the splash screen. Day 3 and lost my place. I figured out that if I clear cache and data, uninstall, install, and re-authenticate, then it will work again.",4
"The best app where you can learn different courses. It is very immersive, practical. It first teaches you the basics, as in how to first think of it and then gets deeper, which I love it!",5
No dark mode and no offline mode really drag down the points here. Especially since this app is perfect for travel or a lesson before bed. Otherwise good material and nice presentation.,3
Excellent but please bring landscape mode it'd be helpful for tablet users ps: 21sep 2022 : thanks for the landscape mode but there's a bug whenever i switch to landscape to portrait or vice versa the completed exercises are being reset and completely taking me back to previous exercise (not like a history scroll through but as if I am doing it for the first time),4
"Perfect! Brilliant is an engaging platform for students like me to learn. Although I didn't use premium, it was still awesome. But I guess paying for premium would be worth it because thus interactive app really helps. I have to be clear on this one: IT HAS ZERO ADS. Thanks so much brilliant!",5
"There is no night mode. The white screen is jarring to the eyes, it's especially painful because I have to read long texts. The option to adjust the text size, and backdrop color for reading is one of the first lessons in UX design-- especially for apps of this type. Please fix this quickly",1
A great way (and oddly meditative) to do math - love!,5
Brilliant is brilliant. A great app to learn new stuff from math story to everything you may be curious. I strongly recommend ♥️♥️♥️,5
Very well designed and well thought out app. Had a bit of hesitation in subscribing but I have to say it is absolutely worthwhile. The explanations are very well written and the animations make it easy to understand. I only manage to get one section done in a day but find it thoroughly enjoyable 🙂,5
"Nothing against the app itself but I installed then uninstalled it almost immediately and it continues to send me emails and when I click ""unsubscribe"" it takes me to a website that has scraped my personal information WITH NO WAY OF DELETING MY PROFILE or ""Account"". When I click ""Contact Support"" nothing happens. So, I guess the ""Brilliant"" was sarcastic?",1
"The puzzles are only ok, but the app itself and it's interaction with any link that Brilliant emails you is SO BAD. Bad enough to make you want to rage-quit. I want a refund, but of course, they make you pay for a year up front. Infuriatingly frustrating. You can't even reset a password without the app blocking your ability to go to any other page than the one you were last on. The calculus section is also written very poorly.",1
"If you're not buying premium, there's nothing there for you. And the premium is *expensive*.",1
"Awesome good start to get you into programming etc so much to choose from and very interactive which makes learning fun and you retain way more information because it's fun !!! With the download free one month subscription the it charges yr card 130 for a year if I remember correctly, but the amount of learning and knowledge you can gain from just this app alone is phenomenal..",5
"idea is great, but the main problem is explanations aren't that good for quizes, which makes it hard sometimes to find out how to solve the quiz. Also no video tutorials or explanations make it weak compared to khan academy or any app with the same purpose. it is good for someone who want to practice math and engineering tasks, but he don't mind searching online for solutions.",4
"Forgot to end the trial in time and was charged with a whole years subscription for 86.62 euros. When I realized it a couple of months had passed and I emailed to get a refund which they refused to give me. I then tried to get them to only charge me for the months that had passed which they also refused to do even though they could clearly see I hadn't used the service at all since the trial. I'm a freelancing artist, this extra expense is not fun right now.",1
"Had so many account and billing issues that I could barely use it to get a a decent feel if it would be any good long term yet depsite cancelling trial, they still tried to bill me. Looked decent but expensive. However after frustrations with account and then still trying to be billed after cancelling, I would not recommend to anyone.",1
"The courses improved quite a bit. Their new courses are much better than just a year ago. For example, Calculus in a nutshell is far better than Linear Algebra and Intro to Neural Nets far better than Artificial Neural Networks. I hope they update their old courses with more interactives and better storylines.",5
I see many conflicting information between the courses (mainly the logic thinking). I can report and everything but no feedback whatsoever. I need either more explanation or something is wrong. And I don't know which one it is. Kinda frustrating. Hope the rest will be better.,2
"Loved the app itself, but the pricing... The yearly subscription costs 132€ already including a tax of 21.08€. When buying the yearly subscription with supposed 20% discount the following gets charged: 132€ (already including tax!) - 26,40€ (""20% off"") + 20.06€ ""VAT (standard) @ 19%"" = 125,66 € I.e. 20.06 € ""tax"" get added onto the amount that already includes tax resulting in a ""discount"" of <5 € instead of actual 20% of 132€. I would appreciate some explanation of this math by the developers.",1
"The circle puzzles are adding an unnecessary complexity to simple math and algebra. It would be better if you just indicated the operand instead of the colored arrow. I want to visualize the math not the puzzle. The puzzles are fun in aset of puzzle games. The puzzle reminds me of the ""Stickman"" tool used in the 60s which worked out poorly and made math more confusing for many of us.",1
"Overwhelmingly oversized course tiles and ""nowhere to click for settings"" or anything other than to select a course. How is one suppose to even manage their subscription if the ""ONLY"" thing they can do is select a new course from a random pile that takes up like 20+ screens of space? There's no capability for personalization and I'm paralyzed by this massive mess, that I'm incapable of cleaning up.",1
"Going from 4 to 1 on this. It is overpriced Khan academy, which is fine until you cancel and deactivate your account. I am still getting billed annually and now have to go through a CC dispute with my bank because support says ""its against company policy to refund"" and the page they send me to for additional help can not be accessed with an account that is not active. So here I am out 100 bucks and forced to jump through hoops for a my hard earned money. I will be reporting this to the better business bureau",1
"Brilliant can only be described as what it is, and that which sticks to it's name- it's brilliant. The course is for everyone regardless of their 'internal' ability to operate on a mind rending level. I had downloaded the app on a whim, yes, yet it's kept me involved so far! You won't regret it :)",5
Never got to use it. They want to charge you 200 dollars instead of monthly based subscription. 7 day free trial but why even do the trial if you're not gonna use after the 7 days because it's too expensive,2
The app is good and I really like it but after my first time using it. I can open de app. The app keep loading in the start screen. I have not been able to use the application from 3 days. I try re-installing the app but this don't solve the problem. Help!!,1
"While I have just started, 6 days, I am enjoying challenging and learning topics that interest me. I began Brilliant for two reasons, first to learn more of the subjects that interest me and second, since I am 68, I want to encourage myself to continually want to learn new ideas. Well done Brilliant.",5
"This is a, dare I say, brilliant concept. Being able to review mathmatics of all levels and learn new ideas that you may have been curious about is amazing. The UI is cleab and intuitive. The prixe i believe is amazing for what you get. my only jope is for the price to remain static as more modules are added.",5
overall: the methods displayed in the app are great and very helpful. HOWEVER: there's a bug that locks the screen and makes the app unusable. I'm almost through the free trial and considering purchasing the subscription. If this bug will be fixed I'll do it and change my rating to 5 stars.,1
"It's a nice app, with some very interesting topic, but I would either suggest making it cheaper or removing the option to use it without paying it because that part feels very underwhelming. It doesn't even give you enough info on a single topic to be hooked enough to buy it.",3
"Brilliant introduces a great practical and visual wau to learn concepts in ways you can easily master a topic. My issue, however, is that whenever I click on a link within the app, my app force closes immediately. Please the Devs should help fix this and I can increase my rating back.",2
Excellent app for learning and deloping your analytical skills.,5
"Great puzzles but I wish you could just buy a full app instead of having to pay for a subscription. This app used to be friendly to users who just wanted the free content but with the new changes, everything is designed to push their subscription services more and more.",2
"Downloaded as free app, but it's only free for the short introduction, then $25 a month for the actual app. I'm disappointed because I enjoyed the puzzles and normally don't have a problem paying for an app outright, but I'm so tired of every app being a monthly charge. Far too expensive for what it is.",1
"Update: So, on further investigation, it looks like the new screen capture permission allows the app to detect whether the user has generated a screen capture of the app, but does not give the app access to the actual capture... so doesn't sound like a major privacy infringement.",4
"A year ago I requested for a refund as they automatically deducted it post the trial period. I had requested for cancelling subscription too. This, however was not processed. And yet again, this year too they have deducted the amount without having yet cancelled the subscription. Bad customer service. No action is taken. I really request the refund of that amount back.",1
Too expensive. The app is crashing all the time. I never use the app and they want to charge me for nothing. Very bad experience. It's like a scam. If they want to be reasonable they should refund me without asking anything because I forget that I have subscription and now the want to take the money for nothing. I use the app before 3 years and couldn't found the cancellation for subscription. And now they want to charge me again 118 € . That's a scam!,1
"I was hoping this app would teach me via interactive animations.. Instead it mostly asks me questions and puzzles constantly. Too much emphasis on questions, which is extremely time consuming and frankly boring. Might work for some, but not for me. It's kinda cute though your art team deserves some praise",3
I love it ever since my son downloaded this app his getting more smarter everyday,5
"I cancelled the subscription during the trial, but was still charged $139.80. There is not customer support. Only download the app if you want to pay $139.8 for a math app. The app is decent for a review, I don't think that someone could learn from this app alone, but it is useful for a review. However, I did not want to subscribe and cancelled the subscription in the app before the trial period was over, but was billed anyway.",1
"Brilliant is extremely interesting, informative, and fun. You can learn several things through hands-on courses with explanations. I'm impressed by the amount of effort the creators of this app put in to create a wonderful learning app for all ages. I give this app 5 stars because: 1. Interactive guided courses 2 Free daily problems Anyone who gives this app a negative rating is unappreciative of the positive things about a computer program.",5
It's a very nice app but offers very little in free version,4
"Due to the haggling in the app almost useless unless you subscribe. (And if you do subscribe, make sure to get one of the million discount codes around on YouTube channels - Brilliant is getting just as annoying there as a sponsor as VPN services, and that says something about both their business models. Never pay full price.)",2
"160$ is insane price to pay. Cool at first but as the lessons went on, I didn't understand the more complex concepts. The big issue is that it continues onward and goes to more in depth topics. So I get to the point where I'm learning nothing and taking guesses. It doesn't have a system for when people don't understand.",1
"I can only start the 7 day free trial by subscribing to the agreement of paying for the entire year after the 7 day free trial. And yes, I can disable auto renew subscription but that is after paying for the first year. Well, what if I don't want to proceed with the subscription after the trial period? Do I have to deal with the burden of retrieving my funds from you since you automatically charge my Google account after the 7 day free trial is over.. ???",1
"I love this website and platform. This is how learning should be - interactive, fun, and challenging. My only quibble is how punitive the stats system is for getting questions wrong. Days of leveling can be wiped for a simple misread of one question. I think this is somewhat destructive to my learning. I'm scared to make mistakes and accordingly answer questions. I think learning should be more about taking risks.",4
Please add more courses like management marketing and other stuffs,5
"The app takes your time to create an account and finish a whole lesson to let you know it's actually an P2W app in the end. Very expensive for non-americans, and there's no option to access the full experience without paying (through watching ads for example).",1
"The math section assumes prior knowledge. It is also never clear if you should be using a calculator or graph to solve answers and some of the questions are poorly formated. Sometimes the quizzes reset themselves, forcing you to take them again. Most annoyingly is thatvthere is no ""community board"" to discuss questions with peers within app. The experience doesn't stand up to the very high price. Stick to Khan Academy.",3
"Good idea, very interesting app, but too expensive. Maybe not for USA, but for a standard in my country it is 10x more than I would give for such app. For that money I can pay a real course which i could have benefit from. This app didnt prove me that it would give me enough for the money, and it is annoying when i have to give a billing method before I get a free trial.",3
I just started the app about a week ago and I loved it intill I was charged $127 when I was on my free 30 day trial for $24.99. I tried cancelling my subscription and every other buttom worked but not the buttom to go to subscription page and it really ticked me off and it made me think it is intentional. they still havent gave any update about a refund I requested or any email.,1
"I just wonder that how it can be so fantastic! Brilliant is not just an app but an essential tool for studies and for developing the fundamentals of mathematics, science and computer science. I really love those daily challenges, courses and the style of their meaning. Anyone who hasn't tried it should try it.",5
"Hi i would like you, dear developers, to try and integrate a dictionary, like that of google, maybe for example like you have in the amazon kindle app, Where one can look up a word by taping it with the finger and instantly get the translation or definition. Thank you its very inmportant and will me want to use the app much more often. One reason i dont use it that much is because i get very tired because i have severe ADHD CASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANY EFORT MADE FOR US. THIS APP IS STILL O",3
It is very helpful for subjects like maths,5
"I can't use this app in Landscape mode on my tablet.... It works well on my phone in portrait mode, but I would like to be able to use my tablet on a table with my keyboard and actually be able to write on my notebook. I'm extremely disappointed as this is a wonderful platform to help with reviewing courses for school.",2
I've been using Brilliant app for a year now and it's just become more buggy recently not to mention they changed the design/icons for worse (old design was way better) Also release rate is very slow. They advertise their rich library of stem courses even though half of them aren't finished( instead of finishing them they remaster old one's). Despite this i give this app one last chance. I resubed for another year in hopes they hear me out and improve my user experience.,3
I LOVE this app. The content is amazing (using the CS and Data learning path rn) The best learning resource I have found in 2 years. The building blocks for explaining each concept so that CLICKS are designed great.,5
"Why browse Reddit for hours when you get this neat little app to teach you stuff in a focused, fun way? This is the ultimate new time sink. Being able to aikido my phone addiction into a learning experience has been a gamechanger--if I'm going to be a screen addict, I may as well keep something helpful on screen!",5
"This app has truly helped me with algebra. It has visuals that help me through it's lessons. Some of the topics have practices to help me better understand the lessons. Honestly, this is great for helping you for school as well as out of school or just for fun.",5
"Awesome app. The only app ever which suites my thinking and style. The content here is quite helpful in understanding the real basics and then aims at the stronger level. Simulations are available which add to the fun and make learning more enjoyable. After all, Picasso didn't learn to paint by watching video lectures nor did Einstein. Hope it's me there too...",5
"My goal was to learn physics with this app, but instead of teaching me, it lead me through a course were I was expected to understand concepts not yet taught to me. When I tried to learn these concepts, it told me that I needed a premium account for 120 dollars a month! If you are also trying to learn anything from scratch, like me, I would NOT use this app.",1
"Not worth a subscription. You can find free sites or apps, certainly much cheaper ones with a better experience. This is great though if you want to be talked to like a 5 yo",1
Please add haptics!! It would make everything soo much more satisfying. plssss 🙏🙏🙏,4
"I have subscribed years in hope that one day you guys make more contents in physics. Or at least finish the courses that you made. But, it has been almost 5 whooping years. And not even a gravitational physics part is complete. Why? Just why? At first, it was filled with enthusiast with community driven problem solving sections. But now it's just what it is.",2
"Love this app! Really well done! I'm using it daily to keep my brain agile and learn something in a quick and convenient way. Love how the lessons are broken down in these small digestible units. Makes it great on the go to learn something instead of just mindlessly scrolling through social media. Thank you, Brilliant Team!!",5
Great tool to learn anything from beginners to advance,5
"Brilliant is really doing a brilliant job. But I would still like to give a suggestion. The cost for premium subscription is good only for the European and American countries. Here in India and Asia these things get really troublesome to purchase! But still it is really amazing! Worst thing is that my subscription is about to go out, and I won't be able to repurchase it again, sad!",5
"Great app, but I can't use it due to the pricing policy. I want to pay to you, but why should I pay for the year, if I definitely will not use the app so long? I can pay for month and play a few weeks. So my opinion - 5 stars for the game, and minus one for the pricing, because I don't like, when someone trying to cheat with ""only year"" subscription.",2
"A paid subscription is required, with money details needed right from the get go even if there is a seven day trial I'm not giving away personal money information. Even if I was I'm not fiscally solvent enough. It might be fantastic, I'm not willing to find out. Take the four and like it. Bye.",4
Well developed and enjoyable way to learn!,5
"Incredibly fun and engaging, non-stop fun!",5
I would describe it as a super efficient way to learn. You learn from the base to the top keeping your motivation high all time. You can also see that the app is developed with love and thinking a lot about what the final user is gonna feel when using it. I can not give other rate than 5 of 5.,5
"Super expsensive, easpecially for people in school. However it has greatly improved my test taking abilities and helped my grades. They cover all the math and physics you will need in a concise and instructive way that sometimes professors can't even manage.",4
"I thought I would have to dish out hundreds of dollars for an in person tutor because I am a hands on learner, but Brilliant works just fine for my learning style. I graduated high school 10 years ago and I am preparing to take a placement test for community college. Not only is Brilliant making me feel prepared, but they are helping me with things I thought I would never be able to remember from High school. I am so impressed. 10/10 recommend for all ages",5
"Out of all the tools to increase understanding on certain topics, brilliant is brilliant at allowing people who study a certain topic or just want to learn something new to get that information in an organized manner and for free. Brilliant is one way we can give education to people without having to go through the filtering system mess that is academia. I am very happy with this app, and more apps should be like it.",5
Brilliant! Simply perfect the application or resource is by far the most efficient way of learning its a miracle that in our day they expect 30 people maybe even more to be taught simultaneously about things they have never been curious in or of. This gift allows you to unleash your inner curiosity and explore everything you need to and want to not necessarily needing to stay within the confines of a syllabus. THIS is education.,5
Love it .. honestly have been trying all sorts of ways to support continued learning this platform is awesome for mathematics science and much more. Although history language arts or other things that you may want to learn are not ther niche... this platform for what their teaching is awesome and if your a visual learner they have that covered in spades I'm 36 use this almost every day my son is 10 just trying to keep up 😅 or stay ahead 😉👌,5
"I like it's way of teaching mathematical concepts through simple analogies and clear pictures but I don't really like the freemium nature of the app, nut then again we all have to make money somehow. Most of the explanations are clear yet I can't get the hang of some topics like probability.",4
"Great idea, i like the interaction but there are few mathematical errors and non sense that need improvement which questions the reliability of some other results I've found confusing. Overall: you guys got something interesting that need more work and accuracy. Please continue to improve.",2
Brilliant app for sharpening mind specially in maths.,5
I really want to lean using this app. I really do. This app made math easier to learn for me. It made me understand mathematical things visually. But sadly not every student has the money to buy premium membership. That's why i cant use this wonderful educational app. If they could put ads instead of this membership then it's more than enough for me. I hope that someday something like brilliant (or brilliant itself) will be free for everyone. That's all. Have good day.,2
"Although I have studied some of this stuff, thus is a great refresher, and it works well to prepare students and tutor students in content they need in school and college courses.",5
Great approach to teaching the content.,5
"The app itself is alright, however the wiki pages are covered with a cookie notice that cannot be closed (neither the ""got it"" button nor the ""x"" button do anything), thus making them hard to read. Considering that the wiki pages are what I got the app for this is really a bummer.",2
"Very well functioning and easy to navigate app. Love the approach to the lessons and the user involvement. I wish there were more courses based in biology, all are math, computer science, physics based. Still a great way to spend some down time on your phone.",4
Loads of tiny fun and interesting exercises,5
Experiencing a bug where the interactive switches don't load in properly. Instead of a label on the switch there's text behind the switch that you can't read. It makes doing any interaction difficult. Would like to see a fix before my free trial is up if possible. Edit: spelling,3
"some quizes ask a question based off a diagram below, but there is a big blank white section and then answer choices ( huygens clock, under the classical mechanics course had more then one question with this issue). there isn't an option for reporting that. other wise good service.",3
"I don't usually post much reviews, but oh gosh, this app is just what I've been always looking for! It makes you think, much more than just fallow instructions. I taught Excel for some time and I realized people would never remeber how to do stuff without feeling the need of that. Congrats to the creators for the initiative and the quality of the app.",5
"An app which goes hand to hand with education and fun! Not only maths, but science and computer science courses are included.... But as a person has a dark side, Brilliant has it too! It charges toooooo much for buying a subscription. That's the only thing uncivilised and off track😐 Otherwise it's a cool application",4
"I can not possibly give it more. It's a great learning tool, BUT, it uses imperial units on an app that is supposed to be related to science and it will not allow me to change to only ever show metric. This is extremely disappointing. The app has literally nothing to do with science. It cares about gathering info about you gives you access to absolutely useless cosmetic settings but no option to set to metric? Seriously? This company clearly cares about sales, not science.",1
"The app is great, very intuitive and interactive. Most lessons are both entertaining and interesting. Although, I wish there was a Spaced Repetition card system for lessons we have passed so that things can be easily remembered.",5
"Learning is not really important... But learning in an efficient way and the applications is what makes anything senseful... Through this app I got to realize the actual meaning of learning... All the concepts related to every topic are thorough, and provide you all the necessary basic details, which we usually miss in our regular classes...! 😌 So a really great app recommended for every type of age group people...! 😍",5
"Glitches! When I'm in a course and try to scroll down, it starts lagging and visual bugs appear at the top of the screen. i want to use this app, but cannot due to this. I will correct my review once this is fix. Ama restart my phone and try again.",1
"Awesome app for training your logic & problem solving skills ! The emphasis is on making you think , strategize & developing your intelect. There is also a lot of very practical & useful knowledge to be learnt from Physics & STEM areas. I totally recommend this to anyone willing to push themselves to the next level in smarts !",5
"This app is terrible. I too have had terrible customer service. The free 7 day trial is a JOKE... and taking my money for the entire year before the app actually starts to work appropriately? Let's not forget to add... im still waiting for it to get into the awesome lessons it advertised. And no, NOT for studentS. This is for individuals. Where is my full refund? The BBB is going to hear about this.",1
"Really enjoy this app for keeping brain active. Howeber there python or code snippets you should be able to run constantly fail, time out or return errors. I don't know if it's a scalability thing, but teaching people to code without a means to execute it is a problem.",2
"So far so good, I was skeptical about using brilliant in an app but if the experience is as good as in the website, well done!",5
"Great! But as a smart guy who never paid attention in school (happens) I often don't understand the rules of the game when it comes to some of the algebraic problems. For example the very first one I did trying to find the value of B. The structure of the problem was totally new to me, 1B over B6 with the answer underneath. I thought it was both numbers on top in addition to both on bottom, but I believe it was one on one? I'd ❤ an even more basic Algebra course for dumb arses like me :)",5
Simplified just the path humans need and are supposed to learn. Exceptional!!,5
Beautiful app. Generous free features as well,5
"Learning Statistics from it for Industrial engineering courses and it does better job than any of my classes ever did. As IE, learning probability and statistics by heart is a must and will come to bite you if you just try to complete it without understanding the actual concepts. Thank you Brilliant, I am mind blown and impressed. Only regret is not using this when I actually took Engineering statistics class.",5
"Great presentation, but some content never loads. The feedback integration with Shake is very intuitive. I had to use it because two of the Data Analytics exercises never loaded. I sent a few reports in, hope Brilliant fixes this in future updates.",3
"The best learning app I have ever seen, but unfortunately I'm broke , is there is any solution that I could have access to most of the courses",5
$130 for a one year subscription is absolute nonsense 🥴,1
Refuses to load sometimes. Forces you to subscribe for a year but does not seem to have a year's worth of content available.,1
Why can I not browse through courses if I want to study about other fields? Very disappointed. Will be looking for better alternative apps,1
Very good app that can make me think hard. It's the perfect app to train my math and logic! 😄,5
"I've decided to update my review after a year of use. I'm still completely satisfied with the app and will be renewing my premium account. This app has helped me realize that math isn't magic, which allowed me to open myself up to an entirely new world of thought. It might sound bizarre to say that an app has changed my life but I actually swallowed my fears and switched into a major that I regarded as ""too mathematically challenging for it to be worth it"". Now, I enjoy and seek the challenge.",5
Love the gamification aspect of the app! Easy and fun way of learning something.,5
Truly mind expanding! Great?It keeps getting better with colabbwith Microsoft and others major players in the quantum computing arena.,5
This is so good then I'll do all courses.,5
i should have read the review first before purchasing. bought the premium edition. credit card was charged but still cant access the premium content. their support is non existent. not doing anything to resolve the issue. cant help to think that it is a scam. will have no choice but to dispute the transaction.,1
I didn't think I would enjoy solving the programming problems as much as I do. It's better than Candy Crush😁,5
Very fun way for education,5
"Very good, better than doom scrolling",5
Extremely good app to improve your knowledge.,5
It is really amazing platform to learn about STEM education it really has helped me learn a lot,5
"Support is fast and punctual, upped my rating. This app is not for me, but it shows lots of promise. Wide range of topics with very human friendly understanding. I would like to see more practice problems, hundreds, not tens, before I would subscribe again.",4
Brilliant truly seems focused on teaching people things. This is a very impressive company.,5
"Recent changes made me hate Brilliant even as a premium member since 2019, I'm fine when they removed Community feature, but later they removed the ability to restart a specific lesson, which is very useful and helpful to retain concept in memory for long-term, new UI is bad in mobile devices, interactive contents are opening in a separate window.",5
"Amazing, i love the animations and the design of everything. Finally it's fun learning",5
"The app is pretty great, but the practice section of the website should be available through the app. There should also be a direct link at the end of each course to practice exercises to apply what you've just learned. Without these features, the app is a bit incomplete",4
Am learning algebra on brilliant Its a amazing app 5 stars,5
"nice app, intuitive and fun",5
brilliant is absolutely amazing. it's fantastic for a beginning step into learning how to code.,5
"Absolutely horrible customer service. My trial was set to renew into a mmber ship 1/9/2020, I cancelled my membership on 1/8/2020. On 1/18/2020 I was charged $95 for an annual subscription. No way to reach out to customer service. Have to wait until after the Holiday now to hopefully receive an email. Do not download this or use the trial!",1
I like their approach to learning and it definitely provides a challenge for people like me who seek to be pushed.,5
I am finally learning math after a lifetime of being afraid. This app makes it easy to learn.,5
"I signed up for this app thinking they would bill me monthly. But I was charged $148.50, for a full year all at once, and they refused to refund my money. If I had not written to them asking for a refund, the yearly fee would have ""rolled over"" next year with no warning. I thought this was very scam like. I also found that the lessons were overly simple, not what I expected ... and although I told them that, it didn't matter. No refund. I don't recommend this app.",1
"I love this app. If you're interested in learning more about mathematics in general, the app provides a great way to do so. There are tons of problems, for various topics. The difficulty of each problem scales appropriately as you move through the material, which is great as you always feel like you're learning.",5
Brilliant is a wonderful app that helps student learn more about math and science. I recommend this app to any student that wants to learn or learn more. It has many topics that will help students and if you get a question wrong (or right) you have the option to be shown the explanation of the problem.,5
"I love brilliant but i can't keep my subscription. I don't understand how you expect to attract people if your more expensive then Netflix. I perfer doing something productive but most people would rather pay less, don't use their brain and watch Netflix. You should think about pricing and maybe push for more subscription for a lower price.",3
I love the app. It teaches me the basics and help me understand the lesson that I never thought I would understand in easier way. I hope you can allow the students like me to access the premium by using our student account for free. It would be more helpful for our learning.,3
"I got the app, added my card details and started my 14 day trial. Quite enjoyed it so thought I could pay it for a month and see if it would be useful. Instead, I got automatically charged for the year ~£65. I emailed them asking for a refund for the year and to be charged just the month. I haven't received a response after *5* emails. Not only will I open a chargeback but I'll also take legal action (perks of having a family of lawyers). It's not about the money, it's about the dishonesty.",1
I am overly impressed with this all. Should have printable certificates available somehow...,5
Exceptional learning material and a very well made app,5
"This is a good app. The service is somewhat expensive if not using it daily. While I was studying it was very helpful. But once my needs were met, I cancelled. It was easy to cancel. I do recommend this app. A ""sister"" app would be nice for those just looking to keep up math skills, at a lower price. Again, this is a very good app for math.",4
"Almost everything I love about Khan Academy - just more bite-sized, interactive, gamified, and portable! (Missing a Sal explainer touch in colorful dark mode, but with well-styled animations to help me forget how much I miss the old days of the easy to use gamified Khan academy with missions.)",5
"I've gotten an infinite loading screen twice now and the only means to fix it is uninstalling and reinstalling the app, for the hefty entry price, this is disappointing Dark mode would be great",2
This the the best educational app ever since it solely depends on you to learn what you wanna learn. There are no restrictions and the teaching method is very good. Also courses can be downloaded for offline use and it helped me to gain a lot of knowledge about programming and quantum computing and made me expert in logic. Truely worth it.,5
This is the best way I have ever had things that I liked all in one and I kinda like the experience ❤🤗,5
"Well, I liked the free trial enough. So I decided to let it roll over to a monthly subscription, figuring I could just cancel if I changed my mind. But it automatically signed me up for the yearly subscription and charged me $130 bucks. Super predatory.",1
"Very good and interesting learning experiences but the new style of content (i.e. mathematical fundamentals) resets progress if you're away for a short time or lock your phone, really frustrating and needs fixing asap. Also scrolling sometimes sticks and needs multiple attempts. Also it seems the new content is designed for a web browser rather than the app as some animations are cut off",2
"This app doesn't teach math, it quizzes you on math you already know. The solutions are taught too fast and without adequate or clear explanations. If the other subjects are taught the way math is then this app is effectively useless compared to free alternatives like Khan Academy. I want my money back.",1
"If I could give this zero stars I would. I signed up for the free 7 day trial and the app charged me before the 7 days were up. It was also the yearly charge which is way more than I would ever spend on a phone app. I tried calling their customer support and its just a recording saying to email them. I emailed them and never got a response. Honestly for the content this app is not worth spending any money on, and on top of that the customer service is non existent.",1
"Really frustrating, doesn't teach until you get the answer wrong. Assumes too much prior knowledge in the introduction rounds. Nice idea, but far too frustrating to recommend. Total lack of explanation on how to solve a problem before being asked to solve it. If you don't understand a topic be prepared to guess get it wrong, not have the opportunity to practice what you got wrong and move on to the next question to repeat the same thing.",1
It's really crazy how they expect you to pay so much at one single time i mean the deal is good but the fact is still your dropping 160 on an game its really crazy and the free version is useless it would be nice to have access to lessons with the free version by how duolingo does it have a set amount of hearts and you loose hearts by making a mistake and it takes 4hours+ to regain a heart and plus ads so they gain revenue and still have the premium option to have infinite hearts plus no ads,1
"I have dreamed of using an app similar to this one, incredible work",5
"Fun and engaging with a well balanced learning curve. Personally I can't use it for more than 30min at a time, but that says more about my capacity for concentration than anything else. Good alternative to doom scrolling. The cost is also a motivatior to actually use it😅",5
"The exercises used good visual examples. This make it possible to logically conclude what the answer are. Also, when an answer is wrong, the explanations are helpful for understanding the the correct answer. Explanations are helpful to find the correct answers before checking them.",5
"To be honest, I've learned a lot from this app, at first, the exercise seemed confusing but when you got an explanation or played around with the interactive elements the knowledge began to sink in and the best part was it stayed. AMAZING!!!! Truely Amazing😍😍",5
"The app is good i recommend it for folks willing to understand some sciences but what i suggest is improvement in app reply system when a user send feedback or bug report also more importantly i think the app will be more helpful if the community of its users will get a platform within an app to have crostalks discussions , motivating each others so that to fight the problem of many people lacking motivation and quit!",4
Utterly impressed! Genuinely enjoyable activities that are actually challenging and the explanations are thorough and creative. I've never paid for an app before but one month in and I really wanted to upgrade to premium. Absolutely worth it so far!,5
Honestly the best learning app that I've ever had !! For every exercise there's an explanation so if you struggle (especially with maths) then I really recommend,5
"It would be a great app if it didn't hang every single time. I've done a single stage of a course more than eight times because of this ridiculous hanging. I tried the web version, but it also hangs. As far as I'm concerned, this app is overrated",1
"Pretty good apps that makes us think a lot. Sometimes the answers are really confusing and weird, but that makes us think harder than usually. I think it's better if we can stop the quiz when we finish one session, not being forced to solve several question.",4
"""There isn't a bad subject there is only a bad teacher"" Brilliant is sometimes a good teacher & sometimes a really really bad teacher assuming we have some sort of 'magic' past knowledge & sometimes it just decides to give us techniques that are crucial to the understanding of the subject out of thin air. Good thing in theory requires rework & refining on some lessons",3
"My sole complaint that pertains to ""calculus in a nutshell"" specifically, since this is the first portion of the advanced math sequence I've completed so far. My impression was that the quiz on the material to be taught in each lesson seems to precede the lesson that introduces the material of the lesson to be taught.",5
It's a great app for deep learning of a topic. It would make you to understand things with different perspectives. It does not focuses on memorizing things rather it focuses on increasing your creativity. It would maintain your interest in any course. I would highly recommend this.,5
"The content is great, and the website works fine. The app, however, sometimes won't let you scroll to the right through the thumbnails when you are the course overview. It just kind of locks up. It can be kind of frustrating.",3
"SUGGESTIONS: 1. Add a feature of bookmarking a problem or wiki page. 2. Add a feature which allows users to create personal custom collections or libraries of their favourite wiki pages or problems. 3. App doesn't support landscape mode. So, it's a problem for Tablet users. Consider all this soon please please please.",4
Just excellent. Very rigorous and at the same time easy to understand. The hype about the bite-sized steps is real. It's fun to just do a little bit every day and progress a little bit every day. Can recommend purchasing the yearly subscription wholeheartedly.,5
fantastic learning platform for anyone wanting an upgrade in their knowledge of science or math!,5
"Overall its a nice, clean interface. The explanations are bite sized. Not too overcomplex, just enough to grab the idea. I would really love to see multiple explanations on some of the topics, as sometimes I cant grasp the explanation given.",5
Very great app. I prefer it on a computer or phone opposed to mobile. Each lesson is packed with detail making it easy to learn. I'd heavily recommend to anyone interested in learning or simply just wishing to keep their mind busy,5
"I have subscribed this app fo 1 year and after I found it not useful for me, then i have canceled the automatic renewal for the next year but this app still charged my credit card for the renewal. The CS Brilliant (Kenzi ) promised me refund via email for few days but almost 1 months since the refund email, there is no reply again from him, Sad friend. This app is a scam, keep your money on credit card. Never inform your credit card to the company.",1
"I learned a couple things about coding from it, it's interactive and was a great app. Up until after the first lesson. Every lesson after the first requires premium which costs $25 a month, or $160 a year. That's insane. I'll find some other way to learn.",2
"Its pretty fun the side eye emoji the app shows when you look at the explanations of the answers is very silly in fact the entire banner that says you looked at the answer should be removed as it kinda unhelpful and vaguely mocking, esspecially since the explanations are a big part of the courses and are usually very helpful and detailed.",4
"Previous review disappeared. Review entailed reporting an error using the website and receiving reply stating my experience as erroneous, no problem resolution sought. Replied detailing experiences. Now can not log into the website despite not making any changes to PC. No issues till I reported glitch encountered. Troubleshooting might have left positive impression. Not interested anymore. Missing that human touch in an all too digital world. Will seek knowledge elsewhere. Peace be with you.",2
"This app is full of Bog-Standard word problems that(if we're being honest do more for understanding english grammar) don't get actually explained. Think about it like this, if you follow the logic of learning via intuition, then why are the ""Solutions"" given in formula rather than being written out step by step? Like what if you don't remember PEMDAS, or never retained it back in school? Maybe you don't have every symbol of math/science committed to memory, too bad. This app's a HUSTLE. Thats it",2
"App itself is great, but when entering Code, it always sets the textcursor to the beginning of the textbox, which is immensely annoying ._. And using the desktop version kind of defeats the purpose for me, when sitting at a desk I can also study a book with tasks soooo please fix. Thank you :)",1
Buggy app. Also the content is amazing but it starts asking complex questions before explaining the concepts which is peculiar as it assumes too much prior knowledge and there is no way to learn things before seeing the explanation to the problems. A lot of the questions are trick questions that deliberately go against what was explained prior within that section.,2
"Great app! I would add a special page something like ""roadmap of knowledge"" where you can build a chain of courses. For example: logic -> math fundamentals -> number theory -> ... I know there are two sections ""prerequisites"" and ""next steps"" but seems that roadmap would be more convenient. P.S. Where is a button ""rate app"" in your app? :) Thanks!",5
"I'm still learning, but the app seems great to me, the explanations are interesting and interactive yet quite simple for you to understand. Also I'd like to add that paid options are not so annoying, and you can learn enough without them",5
"Seems like a good way of learning, but atleast on my tablet you can't rotate the screen from standing mode. It's a bit sad that you can't get certificates considering the price but hopefully Brilliant gives me the puzzle pieces I need to not having to spend as long time mindless reading to get a certification later.",2
Best educational app I have everseen and there are many branches of science and maths in at which I find myself very easy to do after reading the information given first they have interactive and brain teasing questions which are best and and the animation is also very cute you actually learn a great thing by doing a simple and play full thing and the animation is also very cute you actually learn a great thing by doing a simple and play full thing,5
The concept of interactive online courses that teaches you complex fields in maths and science is marvellous. The app user experience not only adds to the experience but also encourage users to keep coming back. Thank you Brilliant,5
Great app! I downloaded it in an attempt to cut down on my pointless death scrolling when I have small pockets of free/downtime. Very well made and intuitive to use and somewhat addicting with points and leaderboards. Highly recommend!,5
"Please put ads to use the complete app, i can't pay a suscription every month. The app is amazing, it's complete dinamic and clear with its concepts, but as i said, the subcription is expensive to me, if there was a subcription with ads but cost 20% of the total cost, i will pay for it, but i can't pay for the complete app.",5
"When I first used the app it gave me a trial period and when the trail period ended on July 12th 2020 they took a 1-year subscription fee of 89.04 EUR without notifying me that the trial period has ended!!! I went to their website and canceled my subscription, and they said that my subscription will be valid until July 7th 2021 and it will not be renewed automatically, on July 12th 2021 they took another 89.04 EUR for a new 1-yea subscription!!! Simply deceitful.",1
"Great app! Beautifully designed, easy to explore. The content is approachable but not very simplified which permits an active learning experience. Very important learning tool to approach the scientific concepts.",5
It's really a good app but the only problem i find is that it doesn't provide free course....starting ones are already known so what is the use of it. It would had been perfect if at least one of the subjects were given fully than a bit of all!!😯,3
"Haven't used the app in months, there's no convenient way to cancel your subscription, so you find out when they try to charge you again, but luckily my debit card I used had expired, so now I'm fighting with costumer service so they can cancel an overpriced subscription for me.",1
"Really interesting app, with a ton of different content. Biggest complaint is that they don't have anything built in to allow you to mark up the various grids/problems /etc, which they really should for a mobile app at this price. Some of this stuff is impossible to just do in your head.",4
"I have tried the learn to program python lesson. It's buggy, the coursor keep jumping to the beginning of the script. The explanations are also brief. The trial has been fun but I will be canceling my subscription due to the bugs.",2
"Great app, but the worst pricing, I can't afford a year atm so was happy to put the extra money down for just a month until I could, but it's £25 a month which is just ridiculous, I was expecting £12 or something to compensate, so I will have to cancel for now",3
"I liked the preview for this app, and would happily pay for it to fully open up the game. But the only option to pay for it is an overpriced monthly subscription, and that's with the 20% discount for new members. One month of this app is more than most apps cost. Hard pass.",1
I have been using Brilliant app from few days ago I was struggling with implementation of theory and basics which decreased my marks and willingness to attend questions about trigonometry. When I opened textbook of mathematics of 12th grade suddenly I started to give answers more precisely and in less time.,5
"🤩Very good app! I ENJOY IT👊! I really recomend downloading 💎Brilliant💎, there are many quizzes that you can choose!🤔 There is something that could be upgraded though 🙂 Sometimes when I am offline, I MIGHT want to finish some quiz questions. But it doesn't let me! How does a quiz require WIFI? Anyway, I normally always have WIFI, so I guess it's fine. That's it for now :) Bye👊",5
"Latterly, I was feeling cluless about sciences since I left the University 15 years ago and I lost the hope of start learning again from the scratch. However, I saw a youtuber mentioning Brilliant ( Thomas Frank) as a learning app. So, I decided to give it a try. Now, I do feel that learning is possible no matter how far you used to be from learning process.",5
"USER BEWARE! I decided to get a head start on my studies going into the new year and began using this application. I had no plans to use the app past the 30 day trial period so upon subscribing I immediately canceled the trial period so that I would not be billed. To my surprise, 30 days later I found a $150 charge by the company even though I opted to not continue my subscription beyond the trial period. When I contacted the company, which was a huge hassle because they do not provide telephone",1
"About a year or so ago I had tried the free version of this app, I found it to be somewhat helpful without really dazzling me. This go around I have paid for the full membership and do not regret it in the least. Will continue to be a member for the foreseeable future. Thanks for improving my cognitive skills Brilliant!",5
"It didn't really capture me to keep going like say Duolingo. I had to push myself to keep coming back during the trial period to look for value. It's far too expensive for me, as much as I wanted to find something to learn and grow in small moments of downtime, I couldn't come close to justifying it.",3
"The app is great. The customer service NOT. I wanted to make sure it a good fit for my teen son to help with math so I used the trial and they charged me an annual fee 5 days later ( it sneaks up on you). I wanted it transferred to my son, but that's a NO.",2
"Excellent, Intuitively and elegantly designed app that has helped me develop understanding in math and physics , complimentary to my degree. Highly recommend. I hope to afford an upgrade to a premium account shortly.",5
"it does not have ai invoice like ""primer"" app does. Personally for me it is very important because when I try to learn quietly my mind starts to wonder and I can't focus. No matter how bad AI invoice might be it is is a great feature to keep you in a learning flow.",3
"You program by draging blocks,this feature is broken on mobil. After changing the number on the loop function, The page gets stuck. I can swipe back out which brings me to the home page not the page that gave me the excerize, it an anoying user experance.",2
Amazing app for learning logic and math! It gives you multiple exercises that makes you think about the problem itself and how to come up with a solution instead of relying on memorizing formulas.,5
"Brilliant is as its name says, IT'S BRILLIANT. I initially installed it for my children, but I use it just as much as they do and am learning so much about so many topics. It is well suited to children and adults. The lessons are fun, interesting, and can be tailored to your goals. With as little as 5 minutes a day. Great for people with short concentration.",5
"Couldn't find an option to opt out of these leagues and reward system. Also, couldn't find how to download offline lessons in the app which is ridiculous. And finally, the content could be better for adults. It is mostly for teenagers.",1
"GREAT app, bad membership. Only offering a yearly subscription (especially when it is over $100) AND not offering much for the free version means this app is made for profit, not eduation. The average person (typically the ones who could benefit the most from this) can't afford that. You miss out on not only educating people, but also on a lot of income by not offering a monthly subscription. What about households? Homeschool families? Really disappointed",3
The riddles are good but it's incredibly overpriced. £5 a month!!!!!! It had a little introduction but it then said you had to pay £5 for every month you used it. Maybe if it was £2.50 a month I might keep it but at the moment it's really pricy.,2
"This is a must have for anyone attempting at logically explaining the world of science. The span of science subjects which touch at a top level on many fine aspects of science makes our curious efforts gather flight. Basically, it challenges you to think and evolve as a learned human.",5
"Absolutely love the app, I've been able to jump into so many different learning topics and my understanding of computer science fundamentals has never been stronger. Did not hesitate to buy the full subscription",5
"What happened to the streak system? I originally could get a daily streak by answering three questions within a lesson, but now I have to fully complete a lesson. I prefer to go through these lessons slowly to fully understand the concepts and am disappointed by this change because it makes me want to rush through the lesson to secure my streak due to the limited time I have each day to work on continued education. Update: Thank you for reverting this back.",5
"Brilliant are by far the best courses I have used for learning. Every concept is explained clearly and simply. The courses are very interesting and thought-provoking, so I would certainly recommend using Brilliant, no matter what level you are at!",5
"I really enjoyed this app for the short time that I had the premium free trial. Unfortunately, they have very limited options to pay for premium and it's just not worth $160 for me. If they had a $10 a month or maybe even $15 a month it might be worth it. Additionally, the app is really not worth your time if you don't have premium.",3
Didn't get past creating an account as I don't like providing card details that require me to cancel if I don't want to subscribe after the free trial. The free trial should be good enough that I feel compelled to subscribe when it ends.,1
"Love the content but the app is very laggy, it doesnt open at all scientific thinking course. I have the subscription and i am a bit disappointed that i cant use the app... have to use to computer instead :/ Ps: it used to work fine in the beginning but not any more.",2
"Nice but very expensive I wish it was a life time purchase for this price instead of yearly subscription , I don't get much time to use this app so I guess my money is going to be wasted because of it, i wish it had something like a pause subscription option or 365 days of usage tracker so my subscription would be deducted by the usage.",3
"At first, I was impressed with the app, so I bought the yearly subscription. However, after using it for a few weeks, I now see that the app is very buggy, and what is worse, some courses are poorly designed and contain typos and even mistakes! Disappointed so far.",3
"It is a wonderful platform for interactive learning. The most important thing in learning is good example that are bite size and incrementally organised. Gaming elements like streaks, leaderboard engage users to excel.",5
"They tried to steal money from my bank card, though i remember i made attempts to unsubscribe, fortunately by the time there was not enough money on account. :) Any way I had to close my bank card just in case though I 100% canceled subscription. And I was right, today they again tried to steel money!!! I got message from my bank.",1
super great way to fill in the gaps from previous education and take my learning to the next level with confidence. it gives me great explinations and has been recently helpful as an aide while reading some vortex mathematic books.,5
Excellent app! Lessons are well structured to give you easy-harder challenges and provide very helpful step-by-step answers after you submit your own. Really a great app with plenty of subjects to learn or brush-up on.,5
"Used to love the daily challenges, but it's really fallen off. Not only buggy, but poorly written and misleading challenges. I would not recommend this to someone for the purpose of learning. Ok for someone who can tell when a challenge is wrong, but just using it to stay sharp.",1
"It is an awesome app! Very challenging and helpful. There is a drawback though, it's not completely optimized for my cell phone's screen (which is a galaxy s10e). I would like the app developers to fix this problem.",5
"Good, but way overpriced. It would be a good deal for $10 a month; month to month. And $5 a month; for the one payment option. Definitely overpriced, specially when Udemy and others offer specialized courses for a fraction of the cost.",2
app requires you too create account before use - no demo - I accessed website too find out more and again it insists on account creation ( not even a welcome screen!).. at least give us a demo or even a sample screen or 2. uninstalled - not going too give email address too yet another spsmmer. nb just clicked on privacy policy - wont let you read it unless you log in !!!!!,3
"Requires your payment info so that you would automatically forget to cancel it. There are great totally free alternatives, I suspect that this is some sort of scam. Also math fundamentals seems to start from very advanced equations instead of fundamentals.",1
"Great app just need some small changes 1. Equations with sliders ( because they are too long to fit in the screen ) are hard to see, because when you try to scroll, you end up on the next page ( since this is horizontal scrolling ) 2. Dark mode maybe ?",4
"The journey through Brilliant is akin to a voyage of discovery, where each concept and lesson becomes a beacon illuminating the path toward intellectual enlightenment. It cultivates not only knowledge but also a mindset that embraces challenges as opportunities for growth. Brilliant instills the belief that, indeed, from a seemingly modest starting point, one can embark on a trajectory toward greatness. Long live Brilliant with its enduring legacy in the field of Sciences and Mathematical.",5
Great app for anyone wanting to learn anything maths and science related. I especially like the daily problems that are based around current events. Even if most of them I can't solve lol. Overall excellent app would recommend to anyone who's either interested in learning or wants to use it to study.,5
"This is a very nice app. Though it is undoubtedly useful for students and teachers in academic world, it is also useful for others who have left academia long before yet want to relearn, relive them orvreaching their children. Appreciate your service. Keep it up, keep it going and growing👍",4
"I love how it has these puzzles with the explanation of each solution. The explanation helps you think in a better way. But don't read them unless you can't get it right anymore, trying is always fun.",5
It's amazing I always learn new stuff on the side and I'm seriously considering getting the premium even though it's quite expensive for my student budget. The way they teach courses is brilliant though. I've never learned stuff so easily before I love it.,5
"Please add support for landscape orientation. That would be very convenient. I know you can do it cool! Your service is probably the best, I want and look forward to more courses with deep content, thank you for your hard work!",5
"Great app to maintain your basic math and science skills, the challenges are varied and will help you keep your edge professionally (given that you work in STEM fields) Update: Latest version has a bug with the ""Continue"" button, I keep getting whole lessons reset by it and it's very annoying.",1
"Very challenging, that even goes for the beginners. Extremely fun and addictive with a well documented explanation of each question for the answers to go alongside. Highly recommended to give it a go if you enjoy the challenge and learning",5
The price of the premium package should be just a little bit more affordable this app is off the chart from another dimension completely totally awesome I'm going to find a way to make it happen to unlock all the courses people we really need this one you got to try it,5
Thoroughly disappointed and dissatisfied. This is just the most boring textbook with a different way to flick the pages. It uses almost no potential phones give to the learning process. I guarantee that a textbook and some YouTube videos are a much better and cheaper option,1
"My version has a black background, which makes it hard to see black text and impossible to see square roots or fractions. I don't know how to change it and it's very frustrating because I have to guess the questions. Besides that, I love the questions themselves! I've missed doing them.",2
"Nice ways of getting gears turning again. I like to consider myself intelligent. However, since graduation and working my professional career, I have accumulated dust on some of the cogs. Brilliant is a great way to excercise the mind lightly and heavily depending on the commitment given.",5
"This is just a very fantastic app, the graphics, explanation and exercise are very amazing. I have learnt so many things in this app. The most interesting things about this app is, it has contain typical subjects concept with comprehensive explanation.",5
"Perfect app in every way for learning science. It's just too much expesinve. Also the monthly subscription is the worst, I would pay just once, even a lot, and be done with it once and for all!",2
"Great concept, but does not support the try and fail method of Khan Academy. As in the answers are set and do not randomize if you go back to try and apply their explanations. That and Computer Science section assumes mathematics background. Speaking as an artist who became a web programmer.",3
"Presents subjects in a very intuitive way that works for how I learn. Occasionally there are some weird issues loading video or interactive simulations so I'll need to reload a lesson, but overall a good experience so far!",4
"Right on your mindy. What i was looking for my whole life in regard to top down learning math and science, conceptualisation abstract and visual thought. well done, such a pleasure to play / learn every time i can, and it feels like just getting started and fresh.",5
The app is okay. But even though I cancelled my subscription before the end of the free trial it charged me anyway! This is outrageous and a huge problem that will probably take more than a day to fix. I can't believe I was charged after canceling! That is unacceptable.,1
"Currently working through it, and while explanations aren't always perfectly transparent, I don't know of any app that compares. It could badly use a dark mode, and the isolated extra drills section should be better integrated and gamified.",4
Disappointed. Too little stats to monitor actual progress and regardless of giving wrong answers the course still counts as completed. Right or wrong answers bare no meaning. Seems silly and pointless. Waste of time and money.,2
"Awesome app for 21st century style learning, especially useful for those who cannot afford the time to crack open a text book with nicely split up chapters within a topic. The interactive questions are great. I find Brilliant more useful than Skillshare for science and technology subjects.",5
The app is amazing but there is a random intermittent screen flickering that makes it impossible to even read the instructions let alone answer the question. This needs to be sorted very soon or I will want a refund.,2
Lots of useful courses. I'm brushing up on my algebra fundamentals and im gonna start learning some calculus and computer science as well as coding in python in the near future. Its super nice when I have 15 mins to waste on my phone I can do strengthen my skills by solving math problems instead of playing candy crush,5
"I like the content but the price is too steep. Also, the daily challenges have basically been removed, since they now are puzzles under courses, and only a few are available for free like normal courses. Not really 'daily' then.",3
Brilliant is an excellent learning and brain training app for enthusiasts of learning and personal betterment. It's unlike any other resource in both accessibility and scope. It's simply one of the best things a person can spend their time on.,5
"A few good explainations and visualizations, but for the most part there's big holes in the lessons. The app is a good supplement, but I wouldn't use it to learn on its own... which makes the price too high.",3
It is a great app but the subscription is ridiculously expensive! Most of us can't make the annual inversion immediately and the monthly fee is way too high. You should really consider this cause otherwise this app is fantastic!,3
"it offers much more than you expect! the only thing that confused me at first was the amount of the courses and deciding which one i should start first, but then i visited the website and they had offered some ""paths"" for each area.",5
This app is simply brilliant. It will help teach you the basics in multiple fields of study that you might be interested in. The app achieves this through interactive puzzles and scenarios to develop a practical understanding of the subject. 10/10,5
"I've used brilliant on my computer and found it to be kind of cool. Too bad the phone app doesn't function. The today page won't load, and none of the courses will start. They just flash open and then close immediately.",1
"Yearly subscription may seem pricey, but after 3 months of using this app, having studied algebra, calculus, probability, statistics and computer science, I can say that it is worth every penny that I paid. It's better than any online course you could possibly find.",5
Thanks for this brilliant app. I found this two days ago and I searched the articles I didn't understand clearly in my Math class and this helped me a lot with greate explainations and well explained examples. The examples given in the app are very easily understandable.Things I searched for are about Counting and Probability.👍👍👍😍,5
"Interesting way to learn. I sometimes have quizzes that fail to load, and have no way to reload, other than force closing the app and restarting. Also, the price seems a little excessive.",4
The images in app get cut at edges and texts gets overwritten especially in some math courses. So I have to go to my pc browser to learn it. Contacted support but no response since 10 days. Very bad app.,1
"So far so good, I only took fundamental maths so far, there is a bug on continue button that should be fixed. I would also like a note feature to scribble and have a storage of highlights. I have high hopes, lets see :)",4
"It’s a fantastic app for learning freak, but too costly to afford for learner from lower middle-income country. So, I have access to introductions only. Rather it would be better if it had allowed ad for non-purchasing user. At least we could learn!",3
"The customer service is very poor. I accidentally missed cancelling the subscription after my free trial expired. Although I did rectify the mistake within 24 hours of the expiry of the trial period, I received no response, despite sending multiple emails. I am really disappointed with the customer care.",1
Good. Crashes every now and then. I use the free version for the daily quiz. Its very fun and i brush up on math and science i learnt in school. But everytime i ask for the solutions it crashes and on reopening the app its ok.,4
"Great app, but would definitely like if they implemented a mode in which you can view all the app's content in exchange for viewing ads, or alternatively, they should change the monthly price for premium to a more reasonable one.",5
"It is really an addictive app and it's a complement. Instead of playing arcade games to cool my mind, I just open this app. As I can't leave my phone for a long time, I would say this is my goTo app anytime. It has a really great content and the explanations again are pretty informative. It really a great and remarkable way of learning things like this. Great job guys.",5
"This app is just what the name of it is, brilliant. It's perfect for people that have difficulties with learning because it gives you the most basic understanding of a subject in a concise way, without having to memorize things extensively.",5
"It's a great app that helps users who learn new concepts everytime. It's a great collection of problems and concepts. It would be even better if you add programming languages like c,c++,java though python is already there it will be easy access on your app for beginners like me if you add the above mentioned languages also other than this it's a great app",5
"Great, but probably best teamed with (free) Khan Academy, as sometimes it only gives you the barest detail before asking you a question, so sometimes you can be stumped. Though you can always not solve the problem and peek at the explanation if you have no idea!",5
I love the idea of this app but in some areas I found the explanations were not sufficient. There were a a few errors as well. The real problem is when the app autorenews. Trying to opt out has been problematic. It's ridiculous! It feels like they're trying to con me out of my money.,1
"I like brilliant, it has been a useful app that helps me look at problems I wouldn't find myself or may avoid and solve them. I recently went back to school and brilliant helped me start thinking about what I would be learning and review old basics.",5
Absolutely perfect. Thank you for helping people getting better at stuff. Thank you also for making it so cheap and accessible and for making the free version so complete already. I think we need more of this apps instead of useless time-wasting games which the world seems to never have enough of.,5
"Works about 2/5 times, so that's its score. Also super slow to load what amounts to a 10kb HTML document. Latest problem, pop-up descriptions are underneath other elements so are unreadable, and the report issue feature doesn't work.",2
"I would love to see a title on each quiz question that reveals the subject matter the question relates to. For example, there was a quiz question that said, ""Some students love English. Some of those students love Math. Some of those students love Science. Do all students who love Science love English?"" It would have been great to know this quiz question deals with Syllogisms. That word could be on the top of the page in bold. That way, someone would have the tools to educate themselves with other resources and get positive reinforcement from this app on what they've learned.",4
This app works really well and is super useful. Only things I might change: add some placement quizzes so people know where to start and some sort of scratch paper capabilities so I'm not doing all these screenshots and memos.,5
"I needed to write a review, I am in love with this app. This app has actual free content and the membership isn't expensive. The topics are interesting and it surely helps to learn some of this concepts such as math, programing, logic, etc. Its a really good app with a lot of knowledge that I am looking forward to learning. :) And you should to by checking it out. It wont disappoint.",5
Great way to learn concepts in a way you will actually comprehend and remember. Gives you a great foundation for more complex concepts. Only limitation is the quantity and scope of material but they're always adding more.,5
This app is phenomenal. The only problem I have which keeps it for 5 stars is that the gifs used to illustrate the problems are sometimes very sluggish. It might be my tablet (Samsung S3) but i doubt it. Absolutely 5 stars if it would be fixed. Thanks for fantastic learning!,4
Clear and interesting approaches. Learn things with lots of fun and easy to remember by images and animations. The courses require no basic knowledge and develop theorems the more time it is spent. Highly recommended and worth the annual payment.,5
"This app is exceptionally brilliant. Although you can enjoy it in the website of brilliant in laptop, smartphone or tablet but it is worth installing app where you get daily challenges with a given course. Its premium membership is versatile and worth buying. You can also enjoy certain courses without premium membership but to get the high complex level you must buy the premium membership. Complete daily challenges and a course per day you will be another in a few weeks or so. #GO BRILLIANT.....",5
"It glitches out sometimes. Like I'm in the middle of a course and it goes nuts. Black squares everywhere, the only way to fix it is to exit the course and enter again. I dont know if that is supposed to be ad that doesn't load or not but it has to stop.",4
"This App is Amazing I haven't gone through the premium version but the Introductory concepts and a wide range of courses is appreciable, good for the conceptual and Practical learning,highly recomended. Just one problem that premium courses are expensive.",4
"I'm an active duty soldier on a line unit, so I don't get a whole lot of free time to explore my other interests like I would prefer to. This provides me with nutritious bite size brain teasers to brain busters. I haven't found an excuse to dive back in to logic, stats or probability since my last year of college. It's most definitely a favorite of mine & will remain so.",5
"Used to be better, the challenge questions many years ago all used to be more challenging and fun. And I can't decide if it's ironic or apt that the computer science courses are the most buggy with the worst explanations. Overall great app",4
"Truth be told, I didnot expected this app to be this amazing when I first downloaded it! I've used plenty of other apps which give the same description but then bombards the user with many ads and silly logical questions. But this one here, this app has been a pure joy when ever I run it. Up untill this date, I never came across a single ad in this app. It's clean, simple and delivers what it promises. A definite 5 start from my side!",5
"Had a subscription for a year. Everything was great, then the app did the automatic renewal. They took my money for renewal and cut off my service. I've provided this company with every piece info they needed to resolve the problem. They simply I have no concept of customer service. The lady ""Karen"", I kid you not, sends you back Google canned responses or she'll ask you to provide information you have already given in earlier communiçation. Terrible customer service, really none at all. ...Well the problem was finally resolved, but not really the way I wanted.",4
"An amazing app! I usually do not buy subscriptions but this app convinced me otherwise. However, I think this app has been priced way too much for people living in developing economies. I understand that it would have taken a lot of money to develop the material in this app but what is the use of it if it makes learning go beyond the reach of masses. I think that the developers should consider special pricing for countries like India.",5
"Really good stuff for about a month, then it runs out of interesting content. Not worth the price tag at all imo. Also very hard to find good courses that are interesting, ui is not setup well for discovery, or maybe they really just don't have anything else?",2
"While the content of the app seems excellent, most of it is locked behind a monthly subscription. You either pay ~$8/month for a full year subscription or ~$24/month. While I like the app and *would* pay a one time cost to unlock everything, I will not do a subscription.",3
"Yes it is very interesting and could be really useful and informative, but really it needs to be paid. It cannot even spread information and educate the crowds for free. At least lock some of the last lessons of topics for premium and lower the premium cost. It is really ridiculous if you enter this app under the presumption that it will be free and informative and will give much information.",3
"Provides challenging puzzles from all sorts of fields. Don't use this as a way to learn the subject, it doesn't work all too great in that regard. However, it is perfect as a way to challenge yourself and improve your thinking",5
"Very informative and educational. The only issue I have with it is that some answer explanations (even for things where I already know why/how they work) could be explained significantly better, but instead are unnecessarily written in an extremely confusing way.",4
"Decent, but there are better resources online for learning, especially for the price. Some of the explanations were poorly written and referred to concepts that had not been introduced, with no links to get more information about those concepts. Khan Academy is a far better and cheaper resource for learning new topics.",2
"Really really really hate the vibration when you get a question wrong. The second I realized I could not disable it, I uninstalled the app. I will probably never try the app again. I will continue to use the browser version of Brilliant. I am a paying customer. Edit: Thanks for the feedback! That is good to hear! I will revisit the app later then.",3
"You get through the course intro and then you have to pay $25/mo to keep going. The explanations are lacking, and it woulf be a cool tool if you wanted to use it to reinforce stuff you learned elsewhere, but the price is unjustifiable.",1
"Acts like it's a starting point to learn about all the nitty gritty understanding of pop science that Neil de grass Tyson and michio kaku keep bragging about. But then it casually explains things in its own technical terminology without explanation. ""experimenters referred to this magnetic moment as a spin magnetic moment μ∝S."" What are these symbols? The writers of these lessons are either highly condescending, or just clueless about how acquainted the layperson is with scientific nomenclature.",3
"This app is simply brilliant! It helps students like me to actively study beyond our curriculum and a big part of it for free. But in my opinion, subscribing to Brilliant would never disappoint anyone.",5
Soooo do I have to pay for this? Says I don't but I can't continue certain lessons without accepting the free trial which renews at £90 or whatever. Bit rubbish if you can't but I understand. Would jsut be nice to be able to sharpen knowledge without having to sign up for classes that are unaffordable or go to college which mental health limits me from doing ATM. All in all I like the app though,3
"Change this irritating, sometimes not even disappearing pop up about payment processing and validation, if it fails then tell me or block me from accessing courses. I don't need to see it every single time I start the app and try to learn. C'mon guys.",1
"I use many online courses services, but have yet to find one that is more engaging and fun than brilliant. Courses are written so well that learning anything becomes a game. I've promptly upgraded to the annual plan !",5
"This app awosome, I just wish they would release some info about what they are planning to add to this app in future updates, I also wish they would include references to books and other sources about the subjects they teach, also I think community reviews on courses and riddles can be nice, but, the most important thing is the riddle attitude learning, keep it up!",5
"This is definitely the most helpful, interesting and easy app to learn STEM concepts. I have been using it for 2 years and have learned a lot. Definitely recommended for all who want to learn STEM concepts easily.",5
"While the courses are really fascinating, I think we should not ignore the community section where many creative and collaborative activities are taking place. I believe this runs aligned with the objective of the app: after learning through the concepts, we apply them to open problems that we are interested in exploring. It is unfortunate that for now the community portion is being displayed at a small corner of Home, which is not even the first tab that appears when the app is opened. I really hope there could be a way to make this link between concepts and actual exploration more obvious. Perhaps we can make the community portion more conspicuous? Or perhaps after finishing all the quizzes under each topic there could be direct links to exciting questions posed by the community to plough further? Overall the app is a pleasant experience, but we could always do better. As an avid learner on the app, I hope we can elevate this app further as a tool of authentic learning that is unlike the drudgery of formal education.",2
"Brilliant! Fun way to learn with playful, clear and concise narrative driven quizzes, as well as their relating explanations. The colorful animations are a fantastic way to problem solve and certainly help with retention.",5
Probably a nice app but I'm no going to spend 20 bucks a month (or 90 a year) for something I don't even know if I like it. That's because all you are able to do is the introduction levels which are easy. With 20 bucks I may as well buy a book with hundreds of puzzles of the desired topic(s) I'm interested in... uninstalled. Edit: what I noticed when I scrolled through the reviews is that there are a lot of ratings without reviews (always 4 or 5 stars and same day). Are they real or FAKE?!,2
i'm up and down on this app. on one hand it's got a lot of content and pretty graphics. wish i didnt pay for it though. the explanations are often wordy or unclear and sometimes questions are asked without first explaining the topic. the paid content just seems much worse,2
"Such an awesome app! It was recommended by Isaac Arthur and his YouTube channel and I'm so glad that I subscribed. It has helped me understand core fundamentals of different types and branches of mathematics, of which, I had struggled and it has enabled me to gain a more complete understanding of the subjects that I love, such as cosmology astronomy, astrophysics, statistics and probability, data science, and the list goes on. I highly recommend subscribing to this app, worth every penny!!",5
"I was always waiting and searching for such an app which will direct us in the most beautiful kingdom of mathematics and science instead of just make us able to qualify an exam and now I got it. It is my first app which I am rating, or rather I have to rate ,only because of Brilliant's brilliance. It is really brilliant app and make us brilliant too. But Brilliant , remember it , SKY IS THE LIMIT. KEEP IMPROVING. BE BRILLIANT AND MAKE BRILLIANT. Thanks.",5
"Great until now. I've been trying to open my latest course, or block in a course and it opens to a blank area. I've updated the app, but the problem persists. I am really enjoying it, but ever since I got the paid version it started with this bug Please could someone help me?",5
"Surprisingly very insightful. Haven't unlocked any of the courses yet, but even just reviewing the introductions and concepts is extremely helpful in everyday best practices. Fitting name for the way it guides you in knowledge.",5
"It's a great learning tool and uses an interactive style that I really enjoy and ordinarily would learn well from. Unfortunately, most of the more advanced lessons in programming use a lot of math, which I have issues with.",4
Tries to bill you in excess of $125 even though you thought it billed monthly. The cancel buttons don't work. The solution I used was to shift my money off that card. It's so-so in its claimed intuitive teaching. I've seen much better.,1
"Don't waste your money on this garbage. I got the annual plan so I could do the ""computer science foundation"" career track or whatever. I finished the whole thing in 4 afternoons and learned almost nothing new. An hour long FREE youtube video on computer science would have been more useful.",1
"Simplifying complex matters in an amusingly educational manner! Expansive and thorough enough on various interesting scientific subjects. Intuitive and tremendously user friendly UI. What more to ask for? Truly well deservedly advertised by the best scientifically oriented YouTube channels out there, such as, Veritasium, Kurzgesagt, Real Life Lore and Johnny Harris.",5
"I've been enjoying my learning journey with Brilliant so far. I'm not good with thinking in numbers, but Brilliant helps me overcome that fear. My big thanks to the educators and developers of the app. Highly recommend a new user of the app to follow a learning path and see how different pieces of knowledge connect together.",5
"lot of emails and notifications, but lack of info in notifications. also when I click on the link it brings me back to the start of 6 questions without an option to go back to where I was. low chance for developers to fix this broken app. ignorant developer reply will result in 1 star reply",3
"Unfortunate for me, hopefully will save others. Most apps that you download display your subscription in your Google play app under subscriptions. Your Brilliant subscription does not display in your Google subscriptions, so when you get that $80 bill for that app you used a couple times, you'll be as upset as I am at yourself, and $80 poorer, with no chance of getting it back.",1
Seems like a great way to spend time but doesn't always work. I get two questions in and then it won't let me interact anymore. If I skip the problem that I can't interact with the next simply wont load. Restarting does not fix this.,2
Offline or downloaded courses don't show images meaning that it's impossible to answer some questions. Images sometimes fail to load even when online. The app is otherwise nicely presented with some good courses.,3
"I like the app, but I don't understand how the streak system works. I've spent almost an hour studying today, completed 9 levels and STILL I can't get my streak updated! I am exhausted. And I'm getting emails every day saying ""Solve just a few problems today to keep your streak going."" Or "" Take 5 minutes to extend your streak ⚡️ "" 🥲🥲🥲 I'm taking an hour every day ""to extend my streak"", guys 🥲🥲 Please, do something or explain to me what I'm doing wrong?..",4
"It offers some very basic information on a lot of topics. It is hard to tell what the harder contents is like for the paid lessons, as that is hidden behind a paywall of 30$ a month or 110$ annually. People can use this app as a stepping stone to find the topics they are interested and watch/read about it on their own by searching it up.",2
"I didnt meant to renew my susbcription, but I forgot. I logged into the app, opened the settings and they had an option to cancel the renew, they instantly initated a refund, no questions asked. That's an instant 5 star from me.",5
"I love the idea of the app and experience has been great so far, but I will not pay €130 for a few puzzles. I might not even want to use for the whole year and definitely not prepared to spend so much money in one go. I think you are losing out on customers by not offering monthly subscriptions.",3
"I love the interactiveness and simplicity of the courses. The app does a great job of using easy-to-understand examples to teach complex concepts, making them appear less complicated. Good job 👍👏",5
"I really enjoyed this program: hic-ups and all. The app lacked some sense of fluidity. On a different viewpoint it seemed to be never-ending, somewhat confusing, and helped keep the E-postman busy: BENIGN AND WORTH A TRY.",4
"Downloaded courses don't load the media (graphs, picture, etc). This problem has been here for years, and the staff won't do anything about it. I recommend to avoid the premium version until they fix this.",1
"Wonderful app full of great puzzles and good courses for any student looking to begin doing higher level maths. Yes, there is a payed version of the app, but the free version is still absolutely worth it.",5
"True to it's name. Still trying to decide whether to subscribe when the trial is over, but I probably will end up doing so. The foundational maths course is eye-opening; they explain the solutions in such a way that it just sinks in easily. Very impressed!",5
"I typically don't really leave comments, but I have to say this😭 This app could have easily gotten five stars from me if not for the fact that for some unknown reason it always takes SO long for the lessons to load if they even end up loading in the first place. I know I sound naggy, but like I really don't like breaking streaks, so this is quite annoying",3
"I'm absolutely loving Brilliant! I love the hands on approach and the intricate and yet intuitive design of there courses. I've been using it for 4 days and I'm hooked, I've recently started learning Linux and this is a huge tool to help me transition into an IT profession.",5
Fantastic Learning site unlike other apps school and tutions you actually learn stuff While school encourages you to rote learn and makes it feel like a chore Brilliant is the opposite Science is beautiful when you dont have an exam to pass and a syllabus to be adhered to The only caveat is that it's not very encouraging so if you have a bad taste with science math you wont like it However if you stick to it it'll be entertaining and educational Free is good - Wiki Courses daily practice,4
"NOT BRILLIANT! This app is cool if u wanna learn and spend heaps of money, but it doesn't tell you when ur trial is over and automatically charges u without warning ( $140)The process to cancel the subscription is like trying to leave a gym, they repeatedly ask you if u want to unsubscribe and show u reasons not too, very tacky and annoying. This app caused me a great deal of stress, all I can say is this app is one of the most abnoxious and decieiving I've ever dealt with. Do not get this app",1
"Really good app, basically duolingo but about math, science, and some things I like. I gave it an 4 star because of the price, I live in Mongolia so the subscription prices are insane to me. But I can use an free trial for an month. I will suggest adding different prices for different currencies.",4
"Navigation, navigation, navigation. If you can not tell where you are at in a course (breadcrumb/ progress bar), it is akin to reading through a straw. ""Continue course"" with no waypoints.",2
"Awesome!! Incredibly well made and very intuitiv. Brilliant does a fantastic job, prooving that learning complex concepts has little to do with intelligence and alot to do with the explanation provided for said concepts.",5
"I think this app is great and I seriously loved it. It has helped me a lot to improve in my logical thinking further. My only humble request to you is that developing your app interface further so that eventually you are able to attract more people, otherwise your app - Brilliant - is brilllliant!!!! Thank you Regards",5
"The service itself is awesome, as is the Browser version of it. The app? Garbage. 10mins to load a course, and general issues. If you have a PC, I recommend the service, but the app? Hell no.",1
I signed up a year ago for a one year subscription for my daughter. She used it for a while but never really got into it. I forgot we had the subscription and no reminder email was sent to me to advise me that it was going to renew. Brilliant just took the money of the card without informing me that they were about to do this and giving me the chance to cancel. This is especially annoying as I don't think we have used the site in 10 months. I find this highly unethical,3
"With the new update some lessons like Astrophysics have become unusable, I can't scroll up or down, neither can I select answers. Some other lessons with new Ux work ok. Note: This is a review of the new update only. I like the app and will revert the rating once this is fixed.",2
"Hi. I really think this app is great, I've really enjoyed what I've gotten for free. But I will NEVER agree to a yearly subscription! I don't have 120 Euros just lying around and I don't even know if I will have the time to use the app each month. Please consider offering monthly payment (and cancellation).",3
"This app is the best! I have never ever seen an app like this before. But it would be nice if it had offline free classes you know, because I am a student running on mobile data ,and always facing problems in that field. That is why I am rating it 4 stars.",4
Started using the free trial until I saw a Brilliant premium membership costs $999.99 per year?! Surely this can't be right. Really enjoyed the free quizzes. Thanks for fixing the bug! Love the app. Changed rating to 5 stars.,5
It's a fraud app. it deducted my money twice from my account even though the app said the transaction couldn't be completed each and every time i tried to make the payment. now it has my master card number and cvv details as well. I mailed the organisation couple of times but yet i did not receive any mail from them even after 4 days. Totally fraud.,1
Great app! Brilliant for Science and Math learners and even people who live and breathe it! I just had a little look at a daily problem and couldn't help but get the pencil and paper out to solve it.,5
Look forward each day to learning a bit more about one of the many topics covered here. Fantastic fun and well written problems to tackle. Thanks! Update - gets better with every update on Web and mobile. Wishing the team a fantastic new year!,5
"I have to give them a 5-star review because of their incredible customer service. I did not use it like I thought I would, so canceled it, and Google's method of trying to trick you into pausing so you'll forget about it worked unfortunately... Well I was able to get my month refunded by talking to them and if I'm ever in a better situation to use the app I'll gladly resubscribe.",5
"Brilliant is great, but this app is a bunch of hot garbage. Lessons take nearly a minute to load, and after one wouldn't load at all I tried it in my phone's web browser - where it runs beautifully, with no issues at all.",1
"Wonderful interactive way to learn. I'm a really busy guy and find doing half a lesson a day is perfect for me. I recommend Brilliant to anyone who is curious and wants to learn about many topics within Math, Science, or Computer Science.",5
"Confused by the pricing structure of premium. Scenario: - I log in to brilliant on laptop. - I click go Premium. - I click annual which says £6.39/month* - It then says £91.94 So do immediately pay 94 quid or is it 6 pound (something) a month??????? App is great but like, my confusion on this just makes me hesitant.",4
"This App got me excited about maths again! As a kid I of course hated maths and science but this has made it fun and interesting in a way that's BRILLIANT!!! I'm hooked on re-learning lost skills and improving my mental acuity to help not only in everyday life, but my career entering the IT industry from scratch :)",5
"Suddenly, without my permission, they have charged me 105€ for the subscription. It's a really cool app but you can't just charge someone like this for an app from one day to the other, this should be done proactively by the user and not in an automatic way. I asked for a refund, if they give it to me I'm going to increase my rating, if they not refund me in 3 days I'm going to return it anyways from my bank and keep the scoring",1
"Tried to rope me into paying over $100 before I even knew what the app really does. I backed out, then got an email I tried to unsubscribe from which just took me straight into the app. No unsubscribe confirmation or anything. No settings or preferences anywhere to be seen. I did not agree to the 7 day trial but it seems like I have it anyway. Does this mean I'm going to get charged? This is unbelievably shady. I'll never use this app now, regardless of what it actually does.",1
Extremely useful and I'm glad that I found this resource early on as a student. Would definitely recommend young curious minds who love exploring Math and Science to join the platform. They offer deep Intuitions and Challenging probelms which are essential for growth in Science. Thank you for building this place.,5
"I love this initiative. It had been a while solving free problems on brilliant so I decided to buy the annual subscription. Trust me, the investment was worth every penny. I totally love the experience and I learn new things everyday.",5
"I would like to say that brilliant is the only one and one best learning platform in the entire world , but I have little request to brilliant team or the organisation of the brilliant that if brilliant team add basic arithmetic math in the course It'll be so convenient and will be helpful for students or anyone those who wants to learn math from beginning or those who are beginners or weak at advance level of math , and I thanks from my heart to organise such this kind of convenience learnings",5
Wanting to learn basic math skills due to having a lack of knowledge because of poor education BUT I had to uninstall because I simply can't afford the $14 a month when I'm already tight on money...which sucks cause I was actually starting to get how algebra works... I hope in the future I can afford the subscription.,4
Amazing app! Even the free version offers some pretty nice features and explanations in a simple and interactive way. It's a very fun way to take on some otherwise difficult topics.,5
"Update: Was contacted by Brilliant customer service and told they would make an exception to their normal refund policy and provide me with a refund. This is appreciated and I hope they eventually decide to update their policy for everyone who purchases a subscription with a trial period. This would demonstrate that they have enough confidence in the quality and effectiveness of their app to risk occasional refunds. Initial review: App was advanced and not for children. Sought refund immediately but was denied and told they have a no refund policy under any circumstances. Not offering a refund is a sign that you have an inferior product and poor customer service. If this negative review turns away 2 customers, they will have lost more money than the refund would have cost them. Not brilliant...",1
"I logged into Brilliant and started a course. I logged in the following day and chose to start a different course. Brilliant still has me in the first course I chose, in addition to the new course. I cannot figure out how to get everything consolidated, even though my log-in is the same.",4
"Results are not (clearly) explained but lesson just continues. Explanations are frequently unclear, poor or wrong. Missing fundamentals (e.g. combinatorics) to properly understand probabilities. Use of conditional probability before being explained. Obvious errors. Unclear, nerdy formulations. Questions asked based on no learned topic. Sometimes you get ""There was a problem submitting this feedback."" when submitting feedback. All in all disordered and hurried up questions and answers.",2
Makes it difficult /hoops to jump through to cancel. Not a fan of the layout of explanations and answers. Overpriced for the content. Easily able get it this education free or cheaper elsewhere.,2
"Terrible renewal policy -- no notifications, and no refunds permitted in the TOS. That said, the app itself is quality and support is excellent -- quick responses, and if you get back to them same-day or soon after an accidental renewal they might be able to refund despite not being against TOS.",4
I have only been using this app for a week now but it is truly an astonishing experience. It allows you to use those dormant brain muscles we left behind in school. Gives you new topics to explore and challenge your current thinking.,5
"There isn't too much critical thinking to be done in the military, so Brilliant has helped me keep my mind active and not forget what I've studied. I would recommend Brilliant to anyone and everyone, especially if you are someone who likes to explore things yet get bored easily.",5
"I've signed up to the paid subscription for Brilliant, and I'm really enjoying this app. I'm doing the quantum computing (QC) and I feel like i'm understanding QC for the first time in this course despite having read numerous books on QC. I have now incorporated my STEM learning with this app into my daily routines, amd it coplements my analogous use of the Duolingo app for learning Spanish nicely.",5
"Interesting topics, friendly explanations, useful quizzes for making sure you got the key concepts and their own wiki with all that additional info that you might need for a better understanding of your chosen theme. Highly recommended!",5
"Seems overpriced for the content available. Some of the content is limited in scope. I would be willing to pay if the subscription rate was about half of what it is now, or perhaps even for a few months if there was a monthly option. But $150 for a year, billed annually, is just too high.",2
"Soo looked forward to using this app and nearly signed up until I saw the price, which I honestly can't afford. I appreciate there are development costs, etc., but with potentially 1M+ milked downloads already ... Maybe there's something more user-friendly out there for us poorer folk to get by with - say an AI chat app? Brilliant! - and free!",1
My phone has far more meaning to me now! all the times i had time to kill so would check news again and again or hunt for wiki pages of interest etc...now i continue with a course on Brilliant to feed my mind...really great resource. worth paying for the full version too.,5
"The app is great, but since you implemented the ""scroll for next problem"" I can't view code because when I try to scroll to see full thing, it slides to the next problem. This should be an easy but it should be resolved quickly.",5
"Brilliant (pun intended) content and a nicely working app. Would get 5 stars if there was a dark mode available... I do most of my reading at night, and can't stand having bright white screens shining in my eyes.",3
"It's good but not really; most of the courses are on logic and strategies to sharpen your common sense but it goes a bit too far, the science courses are good if you don't really know anything on physics/math/logic/etc.",3
"Very good to refresh a lot of knowledge, and learn new cool and interesting stuff. But a colorblind mode would be great, because in some courses it's quite difficult for me to see some things.",4
"It's literally brilliant and I love using it!! :D 2 problems though. It's a tad overpriced (some of us are broke :/) And please oh please add a dark theme, i love to learn at night and my eyes are killing me!",3
"Meh... Some of the questions and the overall presentation feel a bit childlike. I haven't checked the premium content but if I want light-hearted ""science"" I can use KhanAcademy (for free), whereas if I want more depth I'd prefer something like edX.",2
"Some courses are great, some are just awful. Honestly an Indian guy on YouTube does better then some of the math courses. You can only subscribe a YEAR at a time too. I'd rate it higher if the payment plans weren't a rip off.",2
"I've been out of practice as an electrical engineer ever since switching to product management. Brilliant helps me get back up to speed on engineering, mathematics, and computer science -- I love it!!!",5
"Great way to learn about Math, Science, and Compturs, so good I don't understand why they don't hire more people to make more courses on all kinds of subjects, I would love to learn Biology, History, Psychology, Geology, Physiology, Neurology. etc... through this method of teaching.",5
"Pretty nice. However, I expected to see also other programming courses, such as SQL or C. I am using brilliant for a week now (received it as a gift) and seems that if you have interest in math or physics, this is the place for you, but for programming, currently only python is available. I recommend to start adding other coding courses.",3
"Excellent learning tool, however bugs drag it down. Sometimes the ""continue"" buttons cannot be pressed; can't scroll the puzzle with fractions horizontally since that gives me the next puzzle.",4
"This app is great for me, it gives me additional information to what I already know in coding and programming. I recommend this app if you want to brush up your programming for free. Plus it has daily reminders so I can spend time after work 😃 I also haven't found any bug's since the last update",5
"This App looks adorable, neat, authentic, and has already helped me to understand basics of Data Analysis, data comparisons, graphs. I hit the paywall though after just 4 lessons, pausing here as I cannot pay. Will check them out on web. Stay groovy, Brilliant!",5
"You know for an application aimed at knowledge seeking, you sure do an amazing job at pushing away those of us that are truly knowledge seekers with your first time yearly payment. Why would I spend $140 or so dollars when I could just dig through the internet? Is avoiding digging through false/hard to find info really worth $140 a year? I'll stick to learning the old fashioned way. Thanks for the disappointment guys I had high hopes.",2
"It's just next level. Everything is explained in such a detail that topics those I didn't really wanted to learn are just getting inscribed in my brain. And, the board keeps me going when I feel like stopping. Thank you for creating this platform. I look forward to more quizzes, topics and other improvements.",5
"Was excited for this app. I graduated high school by the skin of my teeth and never went further. I was brushing up on algebra, as math was always my weakness, started solving problems easily but the next day I entered a correct value, it said I was wrong, gave me the value I entered, then on another problem said my answer was wrong and gave a clearly incorrect answer. I can accept being wrong and did get some wrong but I'm now remembering why I hated school. Bad teachers, be it robot or human.",2
I tried to subscribe and it wouldn't work on the monthly plan and then kept trying to charge me for a whole year (not doing that). It seems like potentially a great app but I'm really disappointed with how the payments are set up.,3
"This app is true to its name. It's the best learning app that i have ever used. With more than 80+ courses, and new courses being launched monthly, this application is designed to make learning enjoyable and providing you a strong understanding in the subject.",4
"Everything is fantastic. But when I had the need to learn Number Theory, after having gone through a few books, Brilliant's visual approach was just what I needed to really understand what's behind the theory.",5
Wonderful app and loved the puzzles. Unfortunately this is a demo and they want you to pay up to 25 dollars per MONTH for this app. Subscription based apps are highly unethical especially at such high rates. It's just not THAT good and it doesn't even make me coffee in the morning for that price. The price gouging is predatory behavior. There are plenty of completely free resources to learn about any of these topics. This app would have been fine with ads and/or a one-time payment.,1
"The app is great! I actually found out about this app by goodgis.I learned so much about coding by doing their computer science lessons, definitely worth going premium but I do wish they had lessons for learning JavaScript. It is also a frequently used computer language just Like python. I would love if you guys added courses for learning JavaScript.",4
"BEWARE! The app itself is OK, but I decided to cancel after the trial subscription. I preferred to pay month to month. They refused to give refund and charged me for a full year. $129 down the drain. Very shady operation behind the smiley face.",1
"So far so (really) good. I've been using Brilliant for a month almost every day. It is well designed, engaging, and brilliant. We're living a word where it seems someone is pushing us to be dumber (social media?! Huh?) and here Brilliant is your go-to to keep your mind sharp. Well done.",5
"I really havent used it because I cannot pay for it, I just wanted to say, it would be awesome if it had a free options maybe with ads, sort of like Duolingo. It would be very helpful to people all around the world.",4
"Went to through the whole program, now I'm working for NASA!... As a janitor. We all got to start somewhere.... In all seriousness, this program makes you think practically smarter. I find myself trying to use these new found understood scientific principles in my daily life. Life's a wonderful puzzle and Brilliant makes these these personal discoveries refreshingly enjoyable.",5
"Concept is little explained. You're just expected to know with what they give you. Explanation offered, yet not given when you click on it because it will 'reveal the answer'. Why offer it in the first place? Frustrating for someone new to even algebra. Potential users are better off with apps like Khan Academy. Also, there seems to be a money/greed issue judging by the one star reviews. Keep that in mind potential users.",1
"Don't get me wrong I love the learning context but the APK at least in my device is very buggy. For instance, very often I'm finishing a course and the ""continue"" event brings me in the same ending level 3-4 times in the raw.",3
"I think that it is really great, and that it would ask you what age you are and has any kind of difficult topics, but they explain in a simple form for popel to understand, providing them with examples, short questions explanations etc. thank you brilliant",5
"Not a gimmick. in fact, all those advertisements and YouTube content creator sponsor messages were not lying. Everything, right down to the wording and jedi mind-tricks within reminder notifications, all of it encourages a more proactive screen time usage, contrary to the waste of time that is social media. Want to be more productive? Give it a go.",5
I signed up for the week free trial and discontinued the app after 5 days and they still are trying to bill me for the full yearly subscription price. The application does have some good learning tools but to lore a customer in under a trial period and still charge for the service is theft. Consumers beware!!!,1
"Brilliant is great at breat breaking down concepts in smaller, easy to learn pieces. It's really helping me grasp some subjects I've struggled with the past. Well worth the cost of the time-wasting streaming services we all pay for multiples of these day",5
"As an engineer who left most of my technical work behind me once I entered the workforce, but still have a strong desire to stay up on my knowledge, this tool has managed to bring back my love for math, science and everything problem solving. Yes it's relatively pricey for an app but it's so much more - I strongly believe this will make you a smarter person. I know its cheesy, but can you really put a price on becoming a more intelligent human being?",5
"Don't like how it links to Google account wallet by default after your trial period. As if it is banking on people's complacency. Google should stop these kind of practices where potentially people realise too late the amount they have been charged all because of something they did a while ago which wasn't clear how to opt out of it or they completely forgot. When it comes to paying, the user should have the option to select it if they wish to continue to use the full features after trial period",1
"Great app with awesome courses. It's great to find thoughtful courses on advanced concepts that I'd usually have to wade through alone with an archaic textbook. Wish I had this DURING my PhD, but also enjoying it after the fact!",5
This is a well done piece of educational material. I think the lessons are built for my short but numbered attention span and one of the first times I logged on my AI and I beat the exam completely in the width and length of 1 minute. Robo droid still has the trophy and a new hardshell. Hope he's ok I appreciate the coding lessons it seems so monumental the amount of knowledge I see as I view details upon details of different knowledge sets. I hope to build the mobile smart phone platform for,5
"Great lessons but the sentences need to be a bit simplified. The sentences are short but they are hard to understand. And also this needs a dark theme, it's very uncomfortable to see the all white theme even in day time.",3
"I'm an engineer and noticed that my calculus became rusty. It's been almost two years since I bought multiple books to practice it, but never really had time to do so. Brilliant is actually pretty fun and it's always in my pocket. I've been practicing my calculus for last month and feel more confident with it. Thanks!",5
"Terrible!! If you forgot your Brilliant password, it simply jero sending you back to your Google authentication in a circular spiral. You never get out irrespective of how many times you authenticate thtough your Google acount. Since I submitted my credit card information. I have to have my credit card cancel the account. Since there is no way to use account. You simply cannot even get back to the change password page. I suppose they are using Ai to develop these progrsms these days.",1
As a student i've been using this app for the past 3 days and i am enjoying the experience. This app promotes the right method for understanding and applying math and science and also it encourages you to develope a more scientific method of reasoning and thinking .This is the best app for learning math and science :),5
"Wanted premium so purchased it using card but it said error because card doesn't support recurring debits or something but money was deducted from account being 4800INR. I've sent an email of grievance with details and was told that staff was out for the weekend and would be assisted on Monday which is today and I still haven't been contacted. Please help me out here, this is not something that is expected from the people at Brilliant.",1
"Clearly useful courses,advantages present in the amount of courses itself and study fields they covers, explanation and topic-unlocking structure is mostly satisfying in it's precision, with such math chapters as precalculus, differential equations could be more in-depth maiden in terms of uncovering each key concept + increasing various practical exaples",4
"Beyond my expectation, absolutely phenomenal. Easy to understand, proven by me, a grade 10 trying the fundamental calculus, and it's actually pretty easy to understand, BUT ONLY IF YOU do the previous lesson. If you don't get some try previous lesson or chapter if still not, try using Gemini and chat gpt on second opinion(recommended to call it to explain a subject like they're explaining to a high school, child to get different visualization of the subjects or just ask why is the answer this)",5
"Created an account a while ago and trying to log in through the app. I don't remember my password and when i get the link to reset the password, the link just opens the app and doesn't prompt a password reset. Frustrating.",1
"Brilliant is mathematics as it should not and cannot be. This is a lot of scattered information, a lot of incoherent puzzles, a subscription for a year, a lot of sponsored videos on YouTube, the quality of which corresponds to the service itself. It is impossible to teach mathematics in the 21st century in this way: this is a crime against the human mind and the future of mankind.",1
"Phenomenal math problems to solve and I hope they continue to correct UX errors such as, running a model graph that then stall at times etc. and also, continue to update the content as frequently as possible. I recommend.",5
This app is a scam/sketchy this app doesn't allow you to cancel it's free trial subscription what this app basically do is removed the option for managing subscription in settings and constantly trying to renew you trial or what ever u have. luckily my card doesn't have enough money so they keep doing this till they have my money i want someone to look into source code of this app and report it to Google Play.,1
Useful. Would recommend. Only 3 stars because some of the explanations are very bad and they teach a few things out of order. It has been a useful tool for me to get back into algebra. Pairing this app with a book or other learning method seems the best approach.,3
"This service is awful. It is not educational or helpful in anyway. If you want games with an academic facade, you've come to the right place. You should also watch out because they will continue to charge you money even after you have unsubscribed from the service! Just go to Khan academy.",1
"I was tasked to evaluate this App for use in schools. However, much to my dismay, i registered on 18 March 2024, but on 26 March 2024, I was charged not One Month subscription, but was Automatically billed a sum of $165.60 as an annual subscription, which I never did. Now I have sincere doubts on this App. Do I continue to propose this App as a viable alternative ? One class 30-40 students, a whole nation of schools. Would love to have your feedback / report back on this matter.",1
"The app is good, but the price (24.99€/mon) is way too expensive to pay for the amount of content there is (much of the best courses are still incomplete). 3 Stars because the price in the app is 17€, but after I try to pay it becomes 25€, looks like a scam.",2
"I checked out algebra for dummies it confusing for me, as I read the acknowledgements it said I should have checked out the pre-screenin for alegebra for dummies instead of what I was trying to understand. This app makes learning much easier after reading .",5
"Toooooo expensive, and cool designs is not everything. Why should we pay that much, for learning one or two topics. No one is interested to learn all included topics. Udemy course with +4.5 stars and over 30hrs long. just for few bucks. Not more than 13$. Always there are other alternatives.",1
"I'm extremely deposited. I returned to the app after some brake and notice that a lot of content was removed (""retired"" as they call it). The new content is boring, less deep, trival, basically not worth it",1
"Perfect. Download it. I've got an issue tho, I think the streak functionality uses a general time zone, cause my streak got reset before my timezone was over. And a streak freeze would be nice as well, for missing a day under unavoidable circumstances.",5
"I'm learning ahead of all my classes. It well made app with easy to understand problems. The interactive problems are amazing, I'm a visual learner so its greatly appreciated And part of the reason I installed it to my device. 5 star rating in my books!",5
"I did the free trial over a year ago, for my son. He didn't use it. Talked to them after they charged for a whole year that we didn't want it. There is no way to undo subscription as it isn't listed in Google subscriptions, and they just charged me another year!",1
"Awesome app, about to subscribe now, I played the limited version now for a few weeks and I like what I've seen a lot I would recommend this app to all ages, genders, and backgrounds, who are interested in furthering their own personal dictionary in their mind. Thanks Brilliant for the wonderful app",5
"brilliant is the best application to improve a person's performance in mathematics and science. not only does it make mathematics and science more fun and entertaining and enjoyable it teases you by allowing your neuron connections to develop to allow deep thinking and understanding, what all scientists should be like.",5
"I have my worst experience with this app. After I cancelled my premium subscription, brilliant still tried to charge me from my debit card. I even deleted my account, and yet my brilliant account doesn't exist anymore, brilliant still tried to charge me every single day until they blocked my card. This is a scam company, please don't provide them your credentials.",1
"I have nothing to say other than PERFECTION. Yes they have premium feature that you don't need to but you want to. Minimalist UI, easy to understand courses, from to 7 to 70 everyone can use this app. If this app exist before (like 5 year), who know I may pass my high-school exams easy like butter. Edit: Released 2014? Why I didn't hear it before? What a disappointment. I wish I do.",5
"This app is too advanced for this world. I recommend it highly too people in those higher grades like 10, 11 & 12. I couldn't understand a lot. Even when thoroughly reading, it didn't work out. But I'll use it in the future!",3
"I like that they are giving free education there. I still don't know if this free is forever or it is just a trial but it's good. Also the way of making me understand is great, the have small sections so that students do not get bored, and the best thing is that the written stuff is not leveled like we have in our school books",5
decent app but won't allow you to 'forget' / 'delete' courses. I started a math course that was too easy but it won't let me forget the course. I checked everywhere and there's nothing on deleting the pathway.,2
"“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” -Mahatma Ghandi. This application is excellent. It is very easy to use, and the format that was chosen is very clean. I love learning and will be continuously using this on my free time. If you are reading reviews wondering if you should download this application; I would recommend it. It automatically saves progress and there are plenty of topics. Also, a big ""Thank you"" to the whole ""Brilliant"" team.",5
"Brilliant is an amazing application for all those how are often intrigued about whatever they learn. Also , there are several puzzles and logic riddles which are very interesting and very often stump people at their first look to them. Brilliant has helped me build my intuition for science and mathematics.",5
"Very nice- and useful-looking app. But the last thing I need in my life is another subscription. It's not even its price; it's the hassle of tracking it. When I can use this for a reasonable flat fee amount, feel free to call me back.",2
You need to work a little bit on this app because whenever I go to the courses' section & click on a course the app frizzes. I'm currently using the website on the laptop but if I could use the app on my phone it will be very great.,4
"For anyone who understands things best when they see a clear image illustrating a concept or principle, Brilliant does a great job. Even for people that have no problem thinking conceptually, Brilliant arranges the relationships between concepts in ways that rarely appear in classrooms or standard textbooks. Good work.",5
"I'm really enjoying relearning and filling in holes in my science and math education. I've been using this app almost daily for a couple months now, and I intend to keep going through all of the content. The paid subscription is very much worth it.",5
Scam! Beware! I used this app for one year and I cancelled the subscription one day after they charged my account because I had no intention of using it again for a second year. These guys charged me for another two subscriptions ... Some kind of breach of contract or something they are scamming? Is this even legal???,1
"Ill gladly give it 5 stars when they finally fix this annoying issue if it wanting to constantly go back to the previous page when youre actually just trying to scroll the page back up. Everytime I try to scroll back up to reread something, it causes the app to go back to the previous page.",5
"So I have had this for a few weeks. And I find that they do a piss poor job explaining anything. I have very little back ground in any of this and I continuously find myself having to search terms or look up videos to explain what the explanation was supposed to be explaining! I feel stupid, and I usually get concepts pretty quick. Maybe I am using the app wrong, but if that's the case then the app should be better organized. I'm gonna stick with it, but you make it hard not to get angry.",2
There is a fee to take advantage of everything it offers but even if you lack the funds you still learn a lot and have a lot of fun doing it. More courses are offered all the time and they give a thorough explanation of every problem's answer.,5
"Extremely good. Teaches from basic to advanced, interactive. Good for people like me, who want to make their Maths strong. Soon we're going to buy premium, excellent experience. Brilliant is Brilliant.",5
"I was frustrated because I couldn't get this....but they solve my problem....so you can believe this app.. they take time to verify your payment....but they must verify.. I will request tha app to add more advanced math like discrete math, abstarct algebra, real analysis...and also computer fundamentals....",5
Just began using Brilliant. It really lives up to the hype! I've just started and I'm on a 4-day streak. I don't know if I'll be able to complete any of the courses without paying but I'll enjoy it while the free programme lasts. Thank you Brilliant.,5
Very happy about the courses and the way you tach but the activities assigned for us to complete in the levels are not working I also reported about it in the app but no response and skip button is also not working so how can I even learn something . very disappointed and two stars just because your courses are good,2
"If you learn at least one thing from anything, then it's worth it. And here u can learn lot of things. Especially science, not just as a subject, but as a way of thinking. Math, not just numbers, but come into life. Thank you.",5
Ideal for learning or refreshing on math. Bite-size lessons are nicely illustrated. Definitely recommend it to anyone looking to relearn the basics. It's like duo lingo for math and science.,5
"You're missing out on customers. I was willing to pay for the app monthly, but you guys only bill yearly. It makes me question who you're marketing this app to because it's not young college or high school students. Maybe this app is for people who already have their tech careers and have the money to pay almost 200 dollars for an app every year. 🤔",1
"Fantastic, but could really use a night mode. The white background is really a bit much. I don't anticipate this implementation however due to this seeming like an intentionally chosen 'brand' theme (drawing this conclusion from the app icon/logo)",4
"There's a paywall that requires you to give credit information for a 7 day trial. Not very user friendly, as they will charge you 24h before the last day and unsubscribing can't be done from inside the app (need to do it from Google play). Let us try the app and then decide if it is worth giving our credit information.",1
"I really love it. I learned a lot from this app and combined with watching educational videos with this, i actually got a topnotcher in science award in my batch. It really made science even fun to do. It also helped me understand some of the math prob. I encounter at school.",5
Best App Ever This app makes me so curious about math science and much more! And im actually realy bad at math but i heard math is a skill that can be learn't so im doing my best but why do you need to pay montly for brilliant why not just one-time-payment? Like paying one time 60€ that would suit me so much better than paying monthly.,3
"Purchased the based on the YouTube content they make, but now regret of purchasing it, No useful or knowledgeable content on the app. For example the Large Language Model only contain information regarding upto Tokenization process, that's not even the starting, Total waste of money, I can't even apply for refund 🥲",1
"I cannot recommend the app enough. If only I had it earlier, if only. People who want to experience magic might want to stay off, however, people wanting to learn a little bit everyday and improve should consider using the app daily. Thank you; The Brilliant Team. :)",5
"From what I can see, you need to set up the subscription on your credit card before you can do the free trial, clearly in the hope you will be too lazy or forget to cancel the subscription. Don't like your marketing tactics so I won't be doing the trial or subscribing.",1
"==Final edit: As of Dec 8th, 2019, Refund received on Dec 4th. Review amended to fit my final thoughts on the experience == Brilliant was of so little use and invisible in my daily efforts that I hadn't remembered it existed until my banking app notified me of my exceeded limit the day of an interest payment (resulting in a 1% yearly increase) Brilliant doesn't cancel or halt the account if your credit card is maxed. It tries repeatedly to pull money out of your account, without notice, even though you clearly have nothing to give. That is, until the day you put money in to cover credit interest. Then Brilliant takes that without notice. My grocery money was removed on the 21st of October. The refund was requested formally on the 22nd, responded to on Oct 28th. After a refund automation failure, it was manually issued a month later, completed on Dec 4th. Brilliant is the *only* service I have been subscribed to with such a skewed cancellation/renewal policy and process. Policies and processes which have left me without food beyond what remains of a half bag of rice from Oct 21st to Oct 30th as I struggled to make rent and bills. I thank Karen for following through with the refund while making it clear that refunds are an exception. This review is amended to reflect their effort and to redact my more pointed opinions. I hope that this review will motivate Brilliant to develop financial policy and processes that proudly speak to a confidence and pride in their products. At present, the lack of notice regarding automated billing displays a conscious ennui towards the average customer which speaks much, much louder.",1
"Brilliant is my favorite app on my phone. It is a better alternative to scrolling endlessly on social media. It may not be free, but it is absolutely worth it for the knowledge and skill you gain. I only wish it had a dark mode.",5
This app does not provide enough learning before testing your knowledge. And the problems are worded in a very difficult way to understand. I would argue your better off using Kahn academy or something similar but free.,2
I haven't had any issues and I enjoy using Brilliant to keep up with the skills and knowledge I learned in undergrad when I can't bring myself to commit to a textbook. I hope they keep adding content in the areas that I use most!,5
"You created a great app, but you are too greedy. It seems like the only thing you care about is making money. If a person doesn't have a premium subscription, then you are literally wasting your time. I profoundly believe that you guys are aware of the number of people who quit the app because they can't even do anything relevant without a premium subscription and not everyone has the funds to pay for the services. Let's be real. At least, a person should have the right to choose two courses.",3
I tried to use this to teach myself programming. It was so buggy that I couldn't even get past the first lesson. None of the buttons worked. It's simply is a terrible piece of software. I am really glad that they offered a trial version so I could see what a piece of garbage it is. I would like it if it actually worked.,1
While the interactive part is really great what kills the app for me is the constant battery of questions involving calculus. I want to learn about various subjects in a fun and interactive way not feel like I'm taking a math test.,2
"Hi, Its a good app for now (I had installed it a few days before this review), but it has a bug. After completing a lesson, the app crashes and I should enter it, again. It'll be appreciated if this issue could get fixed.",3
"Great app!!! Downloaded so many apps earlier but were annoying due to adds. This app is smooth and has a lot of topics that we can solve daily. #suggestion - Increase number of puzzles for each topic and put levels like easy, medium, difficult.",5
"This app does teach you concepts quite well however, the app itself is a batter depleter. My phone battery was depelting rapidly for a while and i completely forott that it started happening after i had installed ithis app. I feel just use the web version to preserve your phone and its battery for the long run!",1
"The absolute best app BUT I think the team hasn't been able to crack the pricing of the app. I think you should start from scratch about pricing and find a way to make it more affordable. I really appreciate your work, you are a 'positive humanity' company, keep up the work!..",5
"Exactly what I needed to broaden my scientific knowledge/awareness as a humanist 😍😍 (Please add more fun and celebration to finishing a course, like duolingo or smt. Also, a tree visualization to all courses -from fundamentals to specialities- would be great!)",5
"I was unable to cancel free trial. After attempting to end premium on the app, the website, and double checking the FAQ the only way I could cancel premium was to delete my account",1
"A good app but it always automatically changes my answer into the incorrect one like when I click the answer I know is correct, when I hit submit it says ""Incorrect"" geez. I feel like cheated on. Fix it and this app would be perfect.",3
"I've had Brilliant for 4y and it's helped a lot in visualising some concepts. However, since then they've removed user-submitted puzzles and barely added useful new content while mainly redoing the graphics and design of old courses.",3
Simply one of the best apps. I don't have a lot of money since I've been having a hard time finding a job. But this app let me learned the subjects I love and kept me motivated. The amount of information you can learn from not paying is great. And makes getting the subscription so much worth it. I have a great love for learning and have been feeling so frustrated and this app set me to tears with how great it is. Thank you so much for this,5
"Nice idea, but very overpriced. Khan academy is better AND free. The Brilliant app is basically like a giant textbook, with a few animations sprinkled here and there. There's a little bit of interactivity, but not much compared to khan academy...",2
Brilliant is a brilliant e-learning app!,5
"Question 2-1 Neural Net quiz says Brain has Online learning, bur also not Batch learning, which is naive. Content is learned by concept groups, which completes as a Batch, which has compilation time as a disk would. Experience instances are stored as units as well, which supports this model.",3
I appreciate the way the lessons are designed.,5
"Seriously awesome content, There is so much to learn, and it is fun to learn in this way. But the app doesn't work as it should, does not load diagrams, even with good connectivity, not even when I downloaded the whole course! Please help!",5
"The app was amazing overall, however there is a pretty common bug where I can't scroll within a lesson that has a quiz unless I swipe from inside the answer space. Still, overall great app would give 6/5 if possible",5
"This app made me realise that even Maths can be fun! I used to hate it and fear it, but the way the questions and concepts are explained with applications, crystal clear graphs and one of a kind user interface has left me awestruck!! Highly recommend it!",5
The app is really good. But it can be even better if more content related to Data analysis/science is added to it. I would like appreciate if there is a separate course on statistics.,4
"It's a really good app, I would just like to have the option to download the courses. Alot of times, I want to use the app when I am inside the Metro for example and I have 30 minutes that I can't do anything.",4
"cool app. Much too expensive the intro problems were cool, but the moment it starts to get interesting they want $25/month or $120 for the year. shame. with a more realistic pricing model I would pay for it.",2
"A lot of the practice sessions just hang in the app. Unable to complete the practice sessions. On the web version I also get a 404 error. Pity, because the lesons are really well designed",3
"Currently an undergrad math major. This app really helps me intuit the material in mid-level courses like multivariate calc. The logic sections are also great. Overall worth the subscription, coming from a broke college kid.",5
"I have enjoyed the no pressure approach to testing and the examples given are always informative and helpful in solving each question. Overall, I would insist on anyone that enjoys challenging themselves to try ""Brilliant"".",5
They kinda just push you forward through the lessons even if you don't understand. The problems are either so easy they aren't a challenge or completely new information with little actual support in digesting it.,2
"Avoid. If you enjoy using the app you are accused of content scraping and your account is deactivated. This happened during my trial period, if it had happened after paying the £100 yearly fee I would have been livid. Feel like I've dodged a bullet, very strange.",1
"Everything is great. The Lessons, the Daily Quizzes and others. My problem is the ""In App Purchases"" where you need to pay just to unlock all Full Lessons. It is really sad for people who are eager to learn like me (2nd Year Junior HS). If you could remove the subscription or minimize the price, it would be ok.",4
"Brilliant is a fun and easy way of learning. I gave it 4 star because it is only available in English. Please add more languages like Hindi,Spanish, Bangla etc for people all around the world to learn easier with their native language.",4
"Can't download courses. The download icon just rotates then stops. Tried this numerous times. It has just been 0 of 60 mb for days, and I also can't download other courses aside from this one. Pls fix, as the offline mode is the reason why I got premium zzz.",1
"Very good. Just what I need to learn about artifical intelligence. BUT ""continue"" button on the bottom sometimes does nothing. As I close and open the app, it works just fine. Although it continues to happen.",3
"I did the free trial and realized I wouldn't have enough for the program, tried to end my subscription on both the desktop site and app. I can't click on subscription in settings on either. My account was then overdrawn by $100. I dont have the money for this. That was the last of the money I had.",4
"The app is very well thought and problems given are very creative, they force you to think in different ways. I think a lot of work has been put into this app. The only reason that I am giving you guys 3 stars is because of the fact that I can't pay for the premium. You guys don't sport debit card or internet banking. In India that's all there is please fix it.",3
"Brilliant is a guidance ai navigation spawning rubrics to grade the advancement of problem solving. It enhances general stat and analysis rubrics to engross the detailed language output feature, to better refine a search or even teach class at home!",5
"I really like the way how brilliant trying to educate in an interactive way. The animations and all are excellent, learning math is so easy with brilliant and this course is the best out of all.",5
Best app for learning and to improve creativity and most of problems are easily understandable by the way of teaching especially step-by-step from basic to advanced. But it's high price and hope it reduces upto 40% but i think it actually deserves it due to the knowledge it supplies to us which no one could.I would recommend this app from 10 year kid to 50 year professionals due to its way of teaching and new lessons. I hope if all teachers teaches like this way anyone would love to learn .,5
The experience with Brilliant is a textbook and interactive lessons in one. It's a very fun way to learn concepts and the interactive aspect helps hold onto the information better than just reading a book.,5
Great app very helpful and easy to learn !!,5
"The app explains things really well (I took the math course), BUT from my expirience would not recommend, because I signed up for the MONTHLY subscription and the app signed me up for the YEARLY subscription, so instead of taking ~60-70PLN from my payment method it took ~300PLN. Personally would not Recommend.",2
"PAID and tried topic on neural networks. given 1 short page of cryptic explanation, and bombarded with 8+ pages quizzes... fundamentals and backprop are all very poorly explained, though formulas look correct. looks more like college grad trying to answer exam questions, than an internet guru explaining how it works.",1
"I purchased this app for the ""offline mode"" as half the year due to my job, I have an internet connection only once a month. It's very disappointing that I am unable to continue using Brilliant. The content itself is great.",3
Scam Alert! They charge for the whole year upfront as soon as the trial period is over. There is nothing brilliant about this app. I found it very confusing and not logical.,1
Excellent App: probably the most fun I've had using an app in a while. The games and riddles are very tricky and will have you thinking and working out that brain muscle. If you like problem solving and critical thinking then you should definitely try out Brilliant. It stands true to it's name.,5
"This brilliant, is amazing!😊 It has a app as well as a website.That's the way the real learning should be. It's interesting, interactive, 😆attractive, but the only problem is the high cost of subscription 😑😒.",5
"For those who really wanted to have a insight visualization and understanding of baffling topics, brilliant provides the smooth and great way to easily grasp and digest those. Overall it's upto a great mark in providing unintelligible things in a plain way.",5
I cancelled my trail before the billing date. Still I was charged Rs 3840.. looks like many have this problem. I don't understand how can you deduct money even after cancellation. You can also see that I don't have premium subscription. I mailed 2 days back.. but no reply.. I am not going to leave this matter..,1
I don't see how this app is useful in helping improve skills. Sure practice makes perfect but giving a solution alone without any conceptual understanding is not going to help one understand the why's behind the how's when it the next problem comes round.,2
I decided to start using Brilliant after seeing so many commercials for it on Youtube and tried out an interactive puzzle they had as an advertisment on Facebook. I have been antibg to improve my math skills and the structure of this app is excellent for that. So far Im really enjoying it,5
"Email subscription scam, sent me an email saying my free trial is about to expire and a premium subscription was going to be billed. I better not see anything charged, cause I don't download apps with automatic subscriptions",1
"Learning is fun. But i a have suggestion for those who don't pay for premium, they should get access to a course if they sponsorship the app on social media or maybe other platforms ,or maybe review it on websites ,and so more people get to know about the app and also more people get to learn the subject they want ,I think many people would be willing to do this",5
I'm absolutely loving this app. Borderline addicted. I am a self taught software engineer and I always look for opportunities to improve my analytical skills. Brilliant just delivers in spades. I never came across anything like it. The approach to learning is completely unique. Kudos to the team.,5
"Cheapstakes, if you wish to reset your account, they intend to charge at the newer, higher subscription rate, not the one you already have. Also they removed the practice section from the app, which is now available only in web browser.",1
The bestest app for spending money to get nowhere education. After installing you have to login again and again to open background and even after installing it just says to buy subscription. Trial will end even they don't send notifications and show buy subscription. This app contain so many bugs like screen stop working and network problems and we have to download offline courses again and again. Happily ever after once for all who have know the truth and lies of app and uninstalled it.,1
"An app based on solving different kinds of puzzles that teach you a certain way of approaching and solving a problem, and thinking about the problem, instead of memorizing, and at the end they give you the idea/the concept of the way you've been solving - that's a brilliant idea. If you like puzzles you will love it.",5
"So much fun, so neat, pleasing to the eye, just a bit expensive. I wish there could be a chance for lower-income people to enjoy this app more, but on the other hand, the app is worth every penny. More apps like that!!",5
Excellent way of introducing ideas. Would like to be able to switch from phone to laptop but it's very well designed for the phone. Ideally a link to supporting videos (users projects?) might be fun ?,5
"Brilliant delivers the promise of teaching a different way of learning, all the while making the whole process of learning much easier and entertaining. I will purchase an annual subscription without a doubt.",5
"This is one the best apps I've ever used. It's beautifully done, incredibly easy and fun to use, and teaches me difficult lessons in just a few minutes. I had not intended to pay when I first downloaded it but it's worth every penny and then some. I highly recommend this app for people of all ages.",5
"The app is too sensitive when scrolling left or right through a quiz/lesson on mobile. I try to scroll down, but it keeps trying to move to the next page. It's super super annoying!! Please fix this, it's making this app unusable on mobile.",2
"Hey, the IDE for typing Python code is exasperating me. The cursor exits the IDE window, or jumps to the first line where the imported module(s) are after I type any char. I then have to touch the screen several times in order to reposition the cursor where I need to type my instructions or variable names, then it jumps again, and so on. It's an exasperating cycle on my mobile phone. How do I solve this?",4
Great app for puzzles and learning.,5
"Almost everything is behind a (fairly expensive) paywall, which is unclear before downloading the app. Practically unusable without paying a lot. I like the idea for the app, but it's misleading what you actually get",1
"BRILLIANT! Literally BRILLIANT, nothing to explain, it does exactly what the application's name is. Hands down BEST application for those who wants to have deep knowledge or have curiosity in physics, Chemistry,Maths and CS. Excellent, job brilliant team, Keep up good work.",5
"I am telling you in 1 line If you have Adhd go for it ✅ , otherwise it's hard to learn maths for me, brilliant org makes that's easy",5
"Best math teacher i've had. Very creative way of explaining things, very intuitive approach. Maybe add more exercises where you need to apply knowledge from various topics in a course.",5
"Really nice app. It's nice to keep all the topics up to date in my brain. Also, it's nice to learn from a very ""hands-on"" side instead of the theoretic university approach. I especially liked the topics by Kurzgesagt.",5
"Almost everything is behind a steep paywall. You can't filter out what is behind the paywall, so if you don't want to/cannnot pay a lot, it's difficult to find what you can do with the app. Generally poor design.",1
"Upon first launching the app you are asked for your name, email and age BEFORE you are told that it's not free. Free trial is only 7 days and the price of $180 a year is way too high for any value this app could give me. It's always a bad impression to me when any app gets your personal info before even telling you what it is and the cost. I can't coment on the app itself because I will never pay what they're asking so I kept my star rating at a neutral 3. Too bad, I was looking forward to it.",3
Another pay to play scam. Deleted immediately. There's no free to use option. You have to create an account and give personal data to even see inside and then you are offered a 7 day trial on a 150 year reaccuring subscription. These kinds of apps should be kicked from the store.,1
"I really love the course design and the way they teach. It's interactive, makes u think (how learning science shud), my only beef is the paucity of courses. Would love to see chemistry, biology, A&P, etc. Then I'd give this 5 stars and a subscription.",4
Lots of interesting topics. Love the idea of the app and what it's trying to do. I'm not sure how advanced things get but seems like this could be a great jumping off point for things you may not have known you were interested in.,5
This app is just awesome. It presents lessons in an interesting way. Besides its daily challenges are very exciting. But more examples should be added in its lessons.,5
I downloaded brilliant and started using it. I was not aware that you have to pay for a whole year upfront. A company in America should appeal to humanity when someone reaches out and talks to you specifically. I don't understand why you can't prorate within the first 30 days. I guess Americans need to start talking about having a law put into place where we can cancel within a given amount of time. Much like the lemon law for vehicles! Submitting a formal commit to The BBB AND SEC!,1
"Hated: sucking up personal information, including full birth date to even test the app. No need! Liked: the puzzles... thought this is worthwhile. Hate: notifications! I do NOT need to be woken up because the app thinks I should pay it some effing attention and is making my phone beep. Seriously. You take a potentially good product and ruin it with all these antics.",1
"To be honest, if you compare the prices between this app annual plan & face-to-face tuition; you will realize that this the annually plan isn't that expensive. In fact, you actually save a lot of money because you didn't have to pay for your transportation. Plus, you can literally use it anywhere you want because it has no schedule that you have to stresses about. But I hope they will add more Biologi & Chemistry course because they are intertwined with each other (including physics). 😉",5
"The content is fantastic, but offline support has been removed and customer service is appalling. I'm from a regional area with patchy internet connection. People here face educational disadvantage, especially in STEM. Brilliant has potential to be an incredible service for people here. Sadly they've removed offline mode. I wrote to complain, citing their FAQ on the topic. I received a generic reply telling me to go read their FAQ. Sad to see this company failing rural people and customers alike",2
"Brilliant. Just really brilliant, nothing more.",5
"Premium costs too much I'd be more than happy to watch a 1-2 minute ad to unlock a module and continue studying so please add that feature, it's a awesome learning platform and I want to continue my course!",3
Why there's not option to change app language?,1
"Nice, has lots of subjects with effective ways of teaching and making things simpler. The problem is you have to get premium for a really cool expreience. Anyway, it helps!",5
"This app repeatedly changes the rules of the subject, expanding and contracting them in often stupid and complex ways. It tries to make you feel smart without actually helping you beyond information dumps. Not to mention it tries to force you to pay money for something so useless I got rid of it after 30 minutes. Run far away from this app.",1
Definetly a worth downloading app! The way it introduces you to knowledge is so simple and complete that anyone can understand. It has got a lot of different qualified courses to choose from. You'll find one that fits you no matter who you are.,5
"Very hard to see many of the visuals in dark mode. I use Android in dark mode, so I have to switch to normal mode every time I use the app. Please either improve contrast for dark mode or include an option to force light mode for the app when the system is in dark mode.",4
I havent been able to open the section that controls my subscription as there seems to be a bug not allowing me to cancel my subscription. Finally managed to get exception but was unable to change in any way my subscription plan and contacting supports is rather Kafkian,1
"This is no doubt the best app, in fact the best way on earth to learn! The best part is that it makes learning fun through it's problem solving element! It's premium subscription is the best investment one can make for themselves!!",5
"I can't log in on my ipad using the Google log in. The button doesn't respond in either landscape or portrait mode. Both Apple and Facebook buttons work, but they are useless to me.",3
"I forgot to cancel my subscription's automatic renewal and with single click I was able to get a refund. This is the kind of customer service standard that all apps should have, kudos",5
"Changing review due to bugs which are not resolved for over a month. Daily problems are not marked in calendar. For a few last daily problems, show explanation gives 404. Update: It's started to get worse with daily problems.",1
Good way to keep the cognitive bolts from rusting!,5
I did not buy or use this app. I did explore the site and was very intriged to almost buying subscription and then I read one user review stating this app/company lacks respect to ones user privicy. I dont believe I should even rate the app...but i give it 3 stars because its a great concept but 'poorly exicuted' by ~possibly not respecting paying costomers digital privicy... -love the concept!,3
"This is the best gift you can have for yourself. What an amazing community. You can almost find everything you need. Even without premium there are lots of things you can do. Specially the daily problems, they are incomparable with anything else in any other platform. Especially I am impressed with the different kind of solutions that this smart people produce. That is so impressive 👏. Everyone solving those problems with so creative plans. AMAZING.",5
"I like the idea and the content, but not the app. Some of my solutions and 
comments have disappeared. Quite long useful explanations lost. The app 
isn't intuitive at all, and doesn't let people ask open questions to anyone 
about some problem The replies can be deleted without warning or 
justification",5
"A true ""free trial"" wouldn't expect nearly $200 ready to be dumped from my account to yours. With this I didn't get to try out the app so moved on to the next one. Don't faulsely advertise, it is deceptive plan Sr bad apps are taking, it's a shame it's now in the free learning section.",2
"One of the most BRILLIANT apps I have ever used. It is a wonderful app for those seeking more knowledge, and provides a very good workout for the brain. Only negative is that most of the features need to be paid for, and many people like me can't afford it.",4
"I'm a computer scientist very interested in math. I open brilliant every week to tickle my curiosity about what I missed in school! I didn't know what group theory was, and number theory was definitely not something I was introduced to in my public school education. Brilliant is brilliant.",5
"I bought the premium version and found spelling mistakes, wrong names, grammatical mistakes and even wrong answers. Too many knowledge gaps and the difficulty level increases exponentially. Also I selected to pay by PayPal and now it's not possible.",1
I love the idea but there are friction points that consistently stops me in the middle of a lesson. Its the frustrating bugs with scrolling and going back and forth to the next page.,2
"Deeper level explanations for foundational concepts which almost all other online course skips. The courses are beginner friendly. If you are looking for a more advance topic (senior undergrad or grad) then, you may not find any relevant course here.",5
"Good app for refreshing knowledge. However, only one lesson is free, then you need to pay either 24.99 per month, or 119 per year, which is toooooo expensive! Can't afford it, and not sure it worth it or not",3
App no longer opens. General experience was good with daily challenges being relatively easy with basic background explained. If you have a scientific background they may be too easy. Did not pay for any courses.,1
I installed this to just give it a try. But they have such highly curated content for just all the subjects i love- from science to math to computer science. It's a great app both for fun and for learning.,5
"This app is fantastic. It's one of the best things that I've found to study and improve my knowledge. But I think the company should consider setting a lower price for low wage countries. It's too expensive for countries like Brazil, for example.",5
The content is amazing and will make you think about the world differently. And it's the easiest and most fun way to learn when you have a few minutes of downtime. I can't recommend this app enough. There is something of value here for all ages and levels of expertise.,5
"It'll begrudgingly teach you. The leader boards are a terrible strategy to promote learning. The leader boards show more that you already knew the topic not that you learned anything. If you follow the lesson they purposely try to trick you on certain questions which is just toxic. Then if you get the answer wrong, there is no way to validate you are actually learning.Go watch YouTube tutorials for a healthier learning experience.",1
Its a really great app. I recommend to those who want to further their knowledge for school. I like the use of diagrams and simple explanations that allow me to understand the concepts well,5
"Cool insights, excellent logic tools, overall the kind of app that every person going through any kind of identity crisis could use to figure out how to better organize themselves. Brilliant!",5
"This app is brilliant. Honestly, the subscription is expensive. But it is definitely worth it. Too bad they removed the daily quizzes, which were very entertaining and encouraging.",5
Easy to grasp of concepts with step by step instructions.,5
"Good content but daily progress doesn't always register, it feels very buggy and it is incredibly annoying. Also the UI makes it hard to navigate/understand the lesson plan.",3
"There are no 'lessons', these are tests that you cannot retake. Learn by taking a test once on a subject that is totally new to you and see how well you learn and retain the information. There is not any article or video pre-lesson, this program just dumps you into the deep end with a test question. Learn the subject first somewhere else and use this program to test your knowledge, but wait, no, you can't preview the lesson (test) to make your own syllabus for self study. Delete and... SKIP!",1
The way Brilliant teaches concepts is different than current education system. The techniques and the way of approaching a challenging problem is not taught in schools. I believe Brilliant is doing a great job in training human brains in an effective manner. I wholeheartedly thank the people behind Brilliant.,5
I just began to play a day ago. I was bored and wanted to entertain myself with math problems. This is a good app for refreshing your memory and improving upon subjects involving math and science. Fun practice.,5
"An amazing application to boosten up your thinking. Well if you are a type to go beyond text books then i highly recommend thus application. If you have got some extra bucks, don't hesitate and purchase the subscription its worth it!",5
"The most valuable lesson learned so far is I don't read questions too good. But outside of that, the concept and content is great and am learning despite the above! It's very self-paced. Great to smash out a few lessons when you have a spare ten minutes.",5
One of the best educational apps you can find out there. A great refresher for what I have studied at school and didn't understand. I hope they can expand the courses depths a little and increase the number of courses too. I am already a premium member 👍,5
I don't think this app is good at teaching anything you don't already know.,1
"Edit: works great now. Scrolling was only unavailable on some pages. Web based is great, new app update is unusuable. You cant scroll down the page so impossible to complete longer questions.",5
"I wish the current education system uses this application to motivate children to learn and grow mentally, the application is very intuitive, it is easy to get hooked With multiple topics and themes I recommend it and the premium account is justifiable",5
An Easy and Practical Way to Learn!,5
"It is good content, bad UI. I'm on a Note9 and struggle using the sliders on the interactive graphics because they just make me swipe to another page instead of moving the spider.",3
I find that someone with a limited or partial background can use previous knowledge to make positive gains with this program. I would like to look into purchasing Brilliant for my small school program of maybe 80 students. What would it cost yearly?,4
"Please for the sake of humanity 😭 lower the premium price here in Indonesia to reflect the purchasing power parity. Adjusting the price to better align with Indonesia's economic conditions would demonstrate compassion and consideration for the financial realities faced by many users here, ensuring fair access to your service. Thank you for considering this matter.",5
Very much don't like the way it takes your subscription after the free trial with no warning whatsoever. I bet it reminds me constantly after I unsubscribe. Pretty underhand in my opinion.,1
Fantastically challenging; possibly unaffordable for me for now. Maybe not; we'll see! It's worth it for Premium membership if you can afford the entire year's subscription payment at once!,5
Sometimes locks up and you have to relaunch and navigate all the way back through the lesson to get back to where you were. Subscription price is too expensive.,3
It is overall a really great app. I enjoy how the concepts are conveyed. I just have this one problem that sometimes the continue button just doesn't react. I hope there's a fix,4
earlier brilliant had problems of the week which were challenging and one could access them forever. now it has daily challenges which are level 1 problems mostly and they expire. i liked the earlier brilliant more.,3
Sometimes the screen freezes when scrolling inside a course. There are also some other UX issues. But content-wise it's by far the best.,4
"Totally worth the subscription, it was an easy and quick way for me to revise known concepts and understand them more in depth for an important exam i have coming. I recommend it without a doubt!",5
"Truly a brilliant way to learn more about math and other technical stuff in a fun way, i truly learn a lot from this app. but for more comfort and enjoyable experience, Dev. can you add a dark mode in the future please.",5
"Never seen anything like this. This app taught me many things that my school and college failed to teach me. I'm currently on my free trial. As a student, I wish I could afford this. But there's no individual student plan. I'm afraid I have to discontinue this app.",5
DO NOT download this app. I wanted to check it out as it says its free. However after 2 days they charged my card for $119.86 without consent from me. I have disputed this with google but they are not willing to refund my money. Now I have to notify my credit card company and dispute this transaction as fraud. Be careful out there people. You can't trust anyone any more.,1
"Good but graphics/images don't load properly and that defeats the purpose of solving visual/geometric probelms. Please fix the same, it would be great to have an native app rather than a web view in android.",3
"This isn't free. You only get the introduction to a course for free and the rest of every course costs money. I needed help in math and this got me excited but as someone who can't even afford subscriptions, this is a no for me.",1
It can't be used offline. I've paid and just want to do the courses on my train to work and regularly lose reception. It should let me pre download the lessons so I can complete them offline.,3
"Courses load quickly and smoothly. It's very easy to understand, and the courses have activities and pictures to make it almost like a game. I highly recommend this to someone who has trouble studying or paying attention!",5
Would be pretty nice if they weren't actively trying to scam you into paying 12 months in advance. Trying to get you to think you'll lose access to your free trial when you cancel. Telling you a monthly fee that they'll get annually. This isn't how you treat customers with respect and I refuse to pay anything because of that,2
"""A BRILLIANT SCAM"" to Take Your $ EXTREMELY HARD TO CANCEL TRIAL MEMBERSHIP- Must Be Done via Google Play BUT App isn't even listed among my Google Play Subscriptions!!! As for the so-called educational material, the learning capsules are akin to a Cliff Notes' version of Cliff Notes. I chose a familiar topic to asses the value of the info provided. None- A short, confusing mess!!! SAVE $ + TIME: Use MIT Courseware- offers FREE comprehensive learning material for a vast array of courses!!",1
"Amazing content, but I'd love an inbuilt read aloud feature, that auto plays, and I can adjust the speed of. This would really benefit for those with reading difficulties.",4
After pay the premium the startup loading screen doesn't charge. It is showing the same square animations without any change. Im losing subscription money.,1
"I've only had this app for a short while, but so far, i like what I've seen. IDK about disruptive ads at this point. The questions are sometimes hard to work out in your head, but I think that adds to the challenge.",4
I just started this app and it is amazing. It really gets your brain motivated. It really has you thinking. It explains things in great detail. I recommend this to everyone. What do you have to lose. I know you have a lot to gain so go ahead and give it a try.,5
FIVE STARS DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE!!!!! LITERALLY THE BEST APP I'VE EVER PAID $$ FOR!!!! I CAN'T RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH SO I WILL INSIST YOU AT LEAST GIVE IT A TRY!! ESPECIALLY TO THE MANY PARENTS THAT PAY THEIR CHILD'S PHONE BILL PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY HAVE AND USE THIS APP!!!! SPECIAL THANKS TO ALL THOSE WHO PUT IN TIME AND ENERGY TO MAKE THIS APP WHAT IT IS!!!!,5
"Juding by the puzzles th aatre available before paying, they are either quite easy or require knowledge that is beyond a learner to the subject and the explanations don't help. Also there is not option for not having a clue how to answer the problem. As I learned nothing from the free problems there is no way I would pay the excesive amount they are requesting.",1
Very expensive for a monthly subscription,1
Brilliant app is really brilliant. It's great. I get a really good experience of this app. Concepts could be understood crystal clear. Quizzes are also really good. Hats off!!!,5
The teaching style does not reinforce what has already been taught. Brilliant would greatly benefit from a Duolingo style approach to helping one brush up on their weak areas.,2
"This app is really amazing. For anyone who loves Maths or Physics or Computer Science, It's the best of all. I really recommend this app. I wish I could go premium but in a country like mine, It's not possible. I wish to know more about it going premium.",5
"Thanks for changing the streak count rules without telling. You do realize your lessons are inconsistent across this app, right? I was using the app to solve 3-5 tasks each days and get my streak (it was 54 days). Now it's unfeasible, because you never know whether it would take a 5 minutes or an hour to finish the lesson. That's very distespectful to your community, especially to comunity that pays for using the app, goddamit.",1
"Topics were fine. Dont get me wrong, your app is nice, but you let people read just enough info for them to hook up and when they want to continue of course you want money. And that was not the worst thing. Your spam notifications were sooo irritating, even emails!!! NO I WONT PAY YOU A PENNY for that.",2
"As someone with ADD Brilliants visual and instructive learning has a great tool for getting into learning things normally taught in school. Which is great, because I'm not suited for normal school's structure.",5
Puzzles and problem solving gives context to these subjects and makes it fun and interesting. Learning stem on a deeper level. This is how it should be taught in school.,5
"DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT USE THIS APP!!! I payed the 150$ for the app, the app is extremely buggy took a long ti.e to log in, when I finally logged back in it says I'm not premium(my credit card statement would disagree) and is asking me to pay AGAIN! support is no help and will ignore your emails.",1
"It's good on computer, however it's insanely buggy on my phone. Don't know if it's because the type of phone I have or something, but it's impossible to learn because of how many bugs they are.",1
Keeps freezing after lessons/exercises. Otherwise it's pretty good,2
"On Android it's very hard to interact. Many times went to the home page and now I'm stuck on step 1/3 of an explanation. Can't move forward or backwards, already reset the app. Poor UI",2
"Learning every day makes me happier and more productive at work and Brilliant has a big part in that. Exercises are fun, simple and challenging enough to keep you interested and Brilliant has a great way of reward as well.",5
Great app to learn new things in a simple and more interactive way. It's nice to learn the basics behind every topic and then make exercises about it. Would recommend!,5
Great app. Sure is a fun way to learn and sharpen your brain while learning in a way you will never forget. Can you actually add an option to switch languages? I would like to have it in french!,5
"An amazing app. It has really interesting challenging problems, interactive courses, and not to mention the amazing community of life long learners. Definitely recommended for anyone.",5
It hops around to different subjects. There is no way to learn any one subject because it moves to the next subject without checking to see if the first subject was mastered.,1
Absolutely amazing. I can feel an improvement in the way my brain is processing the questions I'm answering due to the way they're being asked. Remarkable. Brilliant! 👏 Edit: The UI sucks,5
"Incorrect email offers, deceiving Premium price shown in the app, Premium offers less than before (you cannot play it offline amymore). Nice and responsive customer support, but no actual solution.",2
"Engaging and non-intimidating. I feel more confident in pursuing a computer science degree after using this app, because it strengthens my aptitude for science, math, logic, coding, etc. I'm happy that I found this app, and to whoever created it, I say thank you!",5
First level is great but then it tells me i need premium to continue. There are no payment options without a credit card. Keep getting spammed to continue practicing but it doesn't let me pay,2
This has been simply the best guide I've got! Just need to ask one thing. My app always keeps showing that it's in offline mode. Could you help me with that? My phone is always connected to the internet and I've not turned down any app permission.,5
"A couple mistakes and inability to correct the admins, and sometimes the big picture missing in lessons and problemsolving. Often too knowledge-based - rote is mediocre education. Other times it's pure guesswork. There is no way to use intelligence to get the solution except by ""old chemistry.""",3
So I payed for a premium membership for one month and was enjoying the programs. When I signed in on my tablet it got rid of my premium and Iattempted to contact support about this. That was nearly a week ago and they havent even acknowledged it. 10 out of 10 would not recomend.,1
"Good for kids or to start learning something new. During the 1 hour I tried it, I encountered a few bugs already. Otherwise I found the content to be a bit basic.",3
Predetory payment system. If you purchase the 1 year membership it cannot be refunded even if you decide it's not for you. Also it lacks content. Udemy is a way better use of your hard earned money,1
"This is great for stretching the mind. It's nice that they have the explanations, but with out any prior exposure, a link or help to research more about a formula would be helpful to the future generations of users.",4
Just started with this and enjoying it. I haven't studied formally in 30 years stp this makes a good re introduction and hopefully a springboard top take me further. Something is stopping off line courses from downloading hence 4 not 5 stars,4
"Great app and very educational, but way too expensive, given that it's for casual learning and doesn't substitute a real education. It's disappointing that I cant access this content due to the premium.",2
"Watch out! they say after 7 days trial they wont charge you... But yes, you got it, They DO. Took 100 bucks from my as if it was nothing. I disagree with this kind of business, being in tech myself. Aside from that, a great app for learning, no doubt about that. But this trappy behavior lost the appeal of the app to me..",2
"This app is trash. Canceled the ""free trial"" before the 7 days were up and these people STILL TOOK THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND WON'T REFUND IT. So buyers beware, they will take your money if you sign up for the ""free trial"". Better be sure you can use it before you sign up, otherwise you get nothing but your money stolen from you.",1
Very good... Examples are very easy to understand and we can relate those with surrounding so it helps to understand the concepts very well. Kudos to you!!,5
"It is for every learner, specially for those who is keen of knowledge of science or universe. But there is a problem . i am unable to pay yearly subscription. i tried with rupay debit card. App team please help !",5
A fantastic app for problemsolving and puzzles! There's a great intuitive step by step solution to every problem. Perfect for learning new subjects or maintain your current knowledge.,5
"The app gives you problems, and it gives you answers. But it doesn't explain how to get those answers, so you don't learn how to solve problems yourself. So you aren't really learning anything. For example, I ran into an equation that I didn't know how to solve. When I couldn't come up with a correct answer it just gave me the correct answer as an explanation, giving no insight into how they came up with the answer.",1
Great app! The user experience is fluid and the content is great so far. My only problem is that I can't download the courses so that I can access them while offline. But that's not a huge deal.,5
"Brilliant is an amazing app.It keeps my mind sharp and helps me to spend more time learning new things and having fun during this difficult time that we are living.I love it and I will keep learning new things with Brilliant.Thanks to Brilliant now I don't waste my time with useless things that can affect badly in your education and using your mind correctly.This is the best app that I have chosen to install for improving my skills in mathematic,science etc.This I is my opinion of Brilliant.",5
I love this app so much and the update made the app better but I want to recommend that you make it possible for lessons to be downloaded offline even if it's just 3 lessons it would really go a long way in maintaining my streak especially on day when reception is bad thank you.,5
Never been able to do Algebra did not have maths at School now at age 54 Thanks to Brilliant I actually am starting to understand Algebra.,5
Made purchase with free trial link in email brilliant sent me. Was charged one full month subscription immediately. Three days later canceled the subscription. Still have not received a refund. Ripoff beware!,1
First Impression : After using the app about 10 Mins it's become my favourite app to learn while enjoying the quiz inbetween the Concepts. Really Enjoying 😆 Thanks for making this interactive learning environment. But if this app have dark mode it will be excellent for Night Owl like me 😆,5
I am doing Data Analytics and enjoying learning from the experts,5
"After the update the app is working up to expectations but there is a bit irregularity and annoyance from mobile users which is we cannot access archives of earlier puzzles even though I paid for the premium version please take necessary steps to resolve this problem in the next update. I found another problem after solving everyday puzzles if I want to know the solution on clicking ""check explanation "" it leads me to the home page instead of showing solution of the problem,so I cannot accessit",3
I LOVE this app. This is the only app I've ever considered paying for a premium version of. It's wonderful! I've missed the challenge of homework and this makes me feel so accomplished to learn something new. It's great!,5
"As the name suggests, this app is brilliant. It is perfect to clear basics of mathematics, physics and chemistry (not so much) with fun. You will enjoy to use it with the benefit of learning.",5
"There is know mention of a subscription service in the apps description. Not only that, its a very expensive subscription for what you get. I find this practice very disingenuious. Maybe spend less money running ads on youtube vids and adopt a more compelling buissness model.",1
Please add probability theory as a standalone learning track.,3
"It's awesome, now part of my everyday life. If you're good at math or phisics or something, but don't like the problems you get at school or you find in the internet, this is for you. If you have a problem in school with a subject or just a specific theme in the subject, this isn't the perfect place, but it's cool, I think you'll find what you need and you'll enjoy it. Even if you don't fall into a specific category and you have nothing to do with science, I think you would like it anyways.",4
"It's be great if it's possible to save courses offline. Also, if other payment options are enabled for the premium version. Nigerian ATM cards are never accepted. Even on the app.",4
"This app is fun to learn stuff from, but there's no way of knowing if it's worth paying for the lessons unless you pay for it. Once you take a few courses, that's it. You're forced to pay, no recharges, nothing.",3
"I've tried to use it on Android and on a desktop. Both times the site has been glitchy, not allowed me to sign up, when I finally did and got a password reset, the reset link didnt work.",1
Few glitches here and there. Some lessons have a steep learning curve but overall great UI and useful if you're willing to put in the effort.,4
"Best application on Play Store I had ever found, the way they teach is great. I think there should be low cost or 1 month free for students who are economic backward.",5
Great app. I'm a visual learner so seeing the pictures really helps. Additionally the practice and explanations do a great job of teaching me and cementing the concepts.,5
"It makes everything easy to learn , I adore it! I just wish there were more languages to learn in. English is my 2nd language and even though it also made me learn some new professional terms , sometimes it's difficult to understand things that are a little more complex.",5
"This game is very relaxing, fun and it provides an easy understanding to give us a motive to go further, by looking at all the progress we have done to motivate us. It also helps to the prosuit of knowledge in the young minds of the world we live in. And I would know because I'm 13 years old.",5
"Awesome experience. To test it out I tried two courses, 1 math that I absolutely sucked at, 1 cs that I wanted to learn. Because of the awesome tutorials, progressing on both of them.",5
"Would rate a 5 if they could add a bit more lessons to the free version, but you have to buy premium to get all now. I would advise going to another learning app to have a more free experience.",1
"It is an interesting app way too expensive. The information you find with this app are easy to find somewhere else. Also the texts are made to idolise some people, really annoying",2
I addicted to this. What a beautiful app. Please give many courses. specialy differential equation part and python. Thank you so much. When I get the pro version I was doubtful. But it is my greatest decision. I love learning with brilliant. Keep up this good work Brilliant 🤗🤗🤗,5
"Why the card to try? Do you know the numbers related to forgotten cancellations? A trial should always be free with NO CARD needed, this gives the impression of a company wanting people to truly try it, not just looking for free $$ from folks who forget to cancel before the trial ends.",1
"I paid for the subscription and didn't like this at all. It is stuff that makes no sense even to me, a student that finished advanced calculus. There are way better way to improve math skills, trust me.",1
What IDIOT thought it was a good idea to hide the pricing per month? It must be nice not living paycheck to paycheck. Too bad it's blinded you. It's not readily available on the website and it's hidden in Google's search results. It's actually funny because what does come up says it's a free service but your website says it's free for a 1 week trial. Really smart.,1
Disappointing that the updates have cancelled access to the lesson from the email. Now the email lesson of interest you click dumps you off lost in the app. No connection. The app used to be interesting.,3
This app came up as a free app I never saw how much they plan to charge its a great app but you blindsided me with that ridiculous price tag. Unless I am going to get an accreditated diploma out of this its not worth the 130 you just sucked out of my account. I'm so pissed off you screwed up my bills and you don't have a good customer service like so now I am thinking this is suspicious and I need to report to Google.,1
"Hey team, could you review my application for Mobile Engineer (Android focused)? Looking forward to talking!",5
Very educational and engaging,5
"Wonderful app, brilliantly designed for the phone. Offline downloads are a lifesaver. Everything is well-explained, but leaves room for individual research.",5
Educative and entertaining at the same time,5
Alright concept if it would save progress. I'm discontinuing my Brilliant subscription due to the app randomly showing completed quizzes as incomplete. The service is too costly for such a frustrating bug.,3
Lots of courses even for free,5
Great app for learning basic coding,5
"Very enjoyable in almost any environment. Learning on the go or focusing on learning. Either way, keeps my learning ability intact with puzzles and fun interactive diagrams.",5
"The app is well made and works fine on various supports. Courses are organised and complete. In general, it offers a really practical and fun way to learn science.",5
Definitely one of the best apps for improving your mathematical and computer science skills. Each course is concise and explains each subject in a easily approachable manner,5
"Brilliant seems offering a lifetime subscription as an upgrade from annual one. But in reality, when you try to upgrade you get an error so actually you cannot upgrade.",1
I like the questions. They challenge you. I also really like how the questions get progressively more challenging. This is great as it doesn't discourage one from learning straight off the bat.,5
"Even though I canceled my subscription and have told them to stop, they keep trying to hit my debit card for $129.",1
"The app is alright. Lessons are good and premium price isnt that high. But it lags sometimes and wont let continue to next page. Re-entering course fixes it, but its still annoying",3
It is excellent in teaching you stuff that you should have learned in school in a efficient and fun way. I would recommend for anyone with at least a slight interest in Math and/or Science.,5
"SO many mistakes in this app it's not funny- 🙄 like I'm talking around 50% of the questions I had to give feedback as to why the answers were WRONG & I ended up uninstalling this app concluding that it's actually quite *counterproductive* for one's education & ironically anything _but_ 😳 ""brilliant""; it's quite the opposite & will make you *stupid* if not incredibly *frustrated* when you've actually got an IQ high enough to spot the.. 🤦🏻‍♂️ *intolerable* amount of *flaws* this course has!!",1
It's absolutely fantastic!! If you are a curious person but want bite sized and approachable intellectual stimulation. I wish I didn't wait this long to finally get the app. It's like Duolingo but for general knowledge.,5
It's just awesome! I can say it as a best place for science enthusiasts. Download it and experience the beauty of science. The explanations are very easy to interpret..,5
"I just installed this app and completed 2-3 quiz and i am like it was very easy meanwhile i got the concepts in depth. Being a software developer, it will be my honor to work with you guys. All of you are doing a great work. Right now i am on spree to spread your words to my connections. Awesome 👍",5
I am currently a high school student. I found this app extremely useful. This is among the best of all apps I have installed. But it should also make provisions for making it free for the enthusiast young learners who may not manage to give money for the app. Any way thanks to the creators for making such a nice app.,5
They made me pay 130 Euros because I presumably had a annual subscription eventhough I had a monthly plan. Support won't help me with this problem. As a student this is a lot of money for me.,1
Amazing app but it becomes useless when you don't have access to the internet. Please consider adding offline mode( view course offline) or the ability to download a course.,3
"I love this app!! I enjoy math and science but sometimes the way the course is taught can be super dry. That's why I LOVE THIS APP, because of its interactive learning methods!!! It's so much fun!!",5
"The app is amazing and it would've gotten 5 stars if it had computer networking courses. This is what I was looking forward to the most. Please add ""Computer networking & Data Communication"" courses as soon as possible.",4
"It provides a lot of knowledge on various topics. It's very helpful. But it's sad that the best part can only achieved by subscription. For a teenager like me who isn't rich,it'll be very difficult to subscribe. Guess I'll have to wait till I grow.😀. But in general,it's a very good app.",4
Just started about a week ago since I've moved through two sections of instruction a day. I've been able to fully grasp each concept for before moving to the next. This is definitely worth th he subscription,5
"Great app except that i'm trying to study for college not my understanding of the world, also as a feed back the sound of the wrong answer makes me feel upset and leave the app after a short while so changing it would be better.",3
Good knowledge but clarity of explanation is very hard and complicated. I would recommend to creat more user friendly content which makes explanation more easier to understand. Right now given explanations are really hard to understand.,3
Great content. Buggy app. For instance after finishing a lesson I cannot press Finish and the progress is lost. Please test before releasing. People are not going to pay for buggy content,2
one of the best apps out there to generalize and apply your math concepts anywhere from a beginner to a higher practitioner.But one disadvantage is that you need to go for pro version ptherwise you won't be able to practice majority of concepts,5
Brilliant! This is by far the best learning tool for anyone! It's approach to courses puts the learner at ease and overall is really fun! I just started using it but I am loving it so far. Good job!,5
"Good app, always improving.",5
"Knowledge should be free and able to be accessed by everyone. Besides, the wiki function is extremely hard to access unless searched specifically, don't know the reason behind that.",1
"Brilliant is a platform I can recommend to any.who is willing to learn. But I would really love if they introduce c++, automation, mechatronics and automotive courses. Aside this, I give you a 5star rating.",5
"Makes you understand alot of Mathematical and Scientific topics much better than anything else really, plus it helps you actually apply these concepts into everyday things, also great to develop problem solving skills, makes you a real critical thinker and not to go on passively on your day to day life",5
Nah what this app teaches has definitely been applicable in my life and I'm certain I could do the same for others. Especially at work. A highly esteemed app. And it is put in terms to simple that it wouldn't be understood. Thank GOD. Highly recommended,5
"Such a pleasure. Okay I admit I read philosophy at university, so I'm inclined to like this sort of thing. But I'd forgotten just how enjoyable it is to reason things out. Most work problems are more fuzzy and done in a hurry. It's a relief instead to bask in the certainty of logic and maths.",5
I love this app it's super easy to use just choose a course and start that's it I don't know if there are any ads cuz I haven't seen any but if you need help with math and comp sci then this def the app for you I totally recommend 💯%😎,5
"App crashes if after completing a lesson I quickly click continue while the xp screen shows before it counts up. Correct, it crashes after the first completed lesson regardless.",4
Great app to learn while enjoying the whole experience. Provides great amount of material from various fields of science that you can slowly digest and understand.,5
"Don't use if you have low self-esteem I'm updating my review after using the app for a while longer. I think that it is a good program and I have been enjoying it greatly, and I will continue to use the app. However, this app makes you feel like an idiot. They rarely give you the knowledge you need to answer tough questions correctly on your first try. It's good if you can take the punishment, but if you already deal with self-image issues it could send you over the edge",4
"Beware! They will charge you for a whole year once that trial period is up. Be sure to cancel it before it ends. They will not reimburse you even if you ask for a pro rated amount. ""...unfortunately, it's not our policy to offer any refunds on used subscriptions per our Terms of Use.""",1
"Very interesting, well presented problems. However, without paying a monthly subscription, this app is just a demo, with almost all content locked.",3
"weekly problems are better than daily problems. why stop that? in weekly problems, you can discuss various types of solution.but in daily problems,you are giving explanation,then putting up an question. thus closing the door of thinking out of the box. a davastating upgrade in the face of math.hope you will start the weekly based (basic,intermediate, advance) problems soon.",3
"This app not only helps you develop your problem - solving skills , it is a great time killer. I would suggest an offline mode to make it accessible at all times but furthermore this app is great for all ages 👌",4
"Lots of information! Great app! Keep it up! These mini quizzes between lectures are fantastic, but I suggest they focus mainly on comprehension and not memory.",5
Brilliant is the best app till date to learn new concepts and strenghthen your old ones. The levels of difficulties give you a thorough understanding and problem solving skills.,5
"It has an intuitive UI, engaging exercises, and has been helping me to build my Mathematics confidence incrementally each day. I wish schools used this kind of platform from primary on!",5
"This is good if you need help understanding math concepts on an instinctual level, but not great if you need to learn actual equations, etc. and how and when to use them.",3
"It's a great concept, but the click and drag is so buggy, it's a struggle to scroll through a page not to mention the tolerance required for finishing a lesson UPDATE: May 2nd update fixed this issue",5
"Good app but I uninstalled it after 1 day and multiple notifications about upgrading to Premium. Notify me to remind me about progress or a nudge to engage, sure. But upgrade? After just one day? Sorry. It's gone.",3
Some extra interface work could be done but this is a really fun and interesting app. Glad I decided to try it when there was a sale on the one year subscription.,5
"This is a great app for learning and re-learning Math, Science and Computer Science concepts. Everything is explained in a way that builds on past courses and it is all very well explained.",5
"After a recent update, the color of the font changed to the tone of the background. White letters on white background basically.. I can't use the app anymore",1
They obligate you to buy a 1-year course and if you try it out and you don't want it they won't give you a refund so be cautious of that. So I paid $175 for the year. Now I have a product that I am not using. Just gave money for nothing. Wow how brilliant bunch of thieves no money back guarantee. Be careful before you purchase!,1
I enjoy this app and I've gone to go and sign up for the full premium version a couple of times. However turn away each time at the price. Just way too expensive.,3
Non optional brain exercise. Has terrible bug where it changes your result from correct to incorrect if you view the results after submitting a correct answer. This has happened twice to me. I'll stick to the website. Uninstalled.,1
"Hi, it's the best learning app I've used so far. But the subscription is sure hella expensive. It would be so much help if there's a monthly payment option.",5
Awesome experience. This seems overpriced but it's not at all. I aspire to be physicist and I think nothing on internet is as good as this. However I wish to know more about what physicist all over the world are doing and current projects of educators. Thanks for creating this platform :),5
Enjoying it. Brilliant is absolutely brilliant. I like the practice questions out there and courses are brilliantly designed. I have only one issue that monthly subscription is very costly.,5
"Good app for learning better math and logic skills. Great for students. I wish they had lower monthly fees for the full experience, though.",4
Learning is fun with Brilliant!!!,5
"I signed up for the full year wanting it to be on my family plan. It isn't. I tried contacting them multiple times, with no response. Zero customer service even for people who DO want to keep the darned app and just need help using it.",1
"It is a very amazing app and it makes me fun when i solve the questions correctly specially in daily challanges but even tho i want to try more questions in the courses, i needed to pay but i dont want to barrow in my mother's wallet so i cant even continue in my favorite courses.",4
Excelent app. It has a very good depth in the reviewd concepts. The free version contains enough to learn for a while. Totaly worth to try it. Im considering buying the year subs and y rarely do.,5
"Brilliant: outstanding app for math, science, and computer science. Interactive lessons, clean interface, daily challenges, gamified elements, expert-curated content, premium subscription highly recommended!",5
"The best learning app out there! But most of the time, the texts of questions are longer than the introduction to new topics. That's not nice, who's supposed to read and remember all the questions? xD",4
"Great teaching method, and great course. One thing i like to tell that Brilliant are great. But i think the apps and website should have more Settings features, like course need reset button.",5
"This is great, I work in physics and have picked up a couple of new techniques. For anyone of any age this will help. Fill in the gaps from school whether you're still there or it's a distant memory!",5
Awesome app Have countless number of riddles ranging from easiest to the most difficult ones. Awesome explanations given to all of the questions. Very productive app. My favourite pastime and it is helping me increase my mental ability day by day. Kudos to makers😊😊😊😊,5
"The content is very good, but the price, in Brazil, is too expensive... Actually i'm student and pay my school. My suggestion: make a special price for students, if the objective is really to improve the knowledge of society!",3
Interesting methods for teaching.,5
"Good start, I didn't know a Good slow start is a good start, so i thank you.",5
great lerning tool for the flexible student,5
"It is what I've been looking for, a distraction with porpoise.",5
"Perfect for busy lifestyles. Whether I'm at work during a quiet moment or looking to wind down before bed, the lessons are all concise and easy to stop and start with, so very convenient",5
"Maybe few bugs, but its great app",5
Like the fact that you can continue where you left off day before. Love it.,5
it must be free that consist ads,5
"The app is incredible buggy, I encountered multiple issues in my first 30 minutes. Funnily enough in the menu the Subscription button doesn't work either, so I had to cancel in my browser.",2
great platform to learn its amazing,5
Bare as bones even with premium and some text and explanations were either written by someone who started learning English a year ago or were done by some translator. What I get for ever thinking an app that sponsors Youtubers could be quality in any way. 18.99 euros a month? You people.,1
"The best app in terms of advancement of learning new things , also including the basics. And exploring many new theories and concepts makes learning fun and interesting. But it's expensive too.",5
"Very good lessons with real-world examples, further more, the league, streak, and points u can gain makes it feel like a game, Wich has encouraged me to continue. Bonus, aesthetic appeal!",5
The content and experience of the app is perfectly designed to keep you engaged. I'm having so much fun learning that I end up covering more material than I normally would.,5
Best app for casual studying on mobile,5
"THIS IS THE BEST APP I EVER SEEN. 🥺 I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS APP. 👍🏻 THANKS BRILLIANT TEAM. 🙏🏻 FIRST AND LAST LONGEST STRIKE : 98 DAYS, TOTAL LESSON COMPLETED (FREE) : 237 AND, THE LAST & HIGHEST LEAGUE : EINSTEINIUM LEAGUE. THE DAY WHEN THE APP LOGO CHANGED I DELETE THIS APP, NOT BECAUSE OF LOGO BUT BECAUSE OF MY LIMITED TIME FOR OTHER THINGS.",5
Great app for learning so intuitive,5
"Purchased premium via Google pay, they have not updated for days the subscription status , disappointing service. After 12 days no answer or solution from.support. They charged for premium but cannot use it.",1
NOT FREE!!! And extortionate monthly fees!,1
"Great anual save on black friday, normal price is 104.99£ and on black friday is 104.99£",2
"Can't work out who this is aimed at. The ""courses"" I've tried so far seem so basic and trivial it seems to be for junior school aged kids. The app itself is very slow and doesn't scroll properly.",2
Seems like a really educative app and must be able to connect our daily life experiences with school and tasks given to you in reality and also helps you come to a sense of realization of how concepts and techniques as well as theoretical concepts are done and used,5
This application is amazing: it manages to expand your field of knowledge into something truly useful and at your own pace. School never intellectually stimulated me enough and brilliant sooths my craving for a good puzzle to test my skills on. I'm very interested in computer sciences and I'm happy to say that the premium courses haven't disappointed me at all. This is my best investment yet and I strongly recommend you to purchase the premium version.,5
Forced to setup a free week trial to even use the app. Then rejected refund because I forgot to cancel. The service is too expensive and seems like they scammed me. May update review later if it even seems worth a year subscription.,1
"Great app, great approach. However I cannot login with Facebook credentials to my paid subscription, works perfectly fine with mobile or desktop browsers, only app has the problem.",3
"The app says stuff like you can redo this after 24h, but then only allows you to review it, not redo it. The app halts your progress under the trial, and I hate the competition aspect (league) and I cannot opt out.",2
The premium version of this is inexpensive and far superior to Khan Academy. It teaches concepts clearly and intuitively and then makes the student work and think to solve problems.,5
"Brilliant only worked for some minutes. The app and sites are crashing continuously and I can't continue my lessons. Even with Wi-Fi, the app doesn't work.",1
Buggy as it was but the latest update made it completely impossible to scroll through any of the lessons. I would like to love it but this is just unacceptable for the large amount of money they ask for a subscription.,2
"Great app and great content. Unfortunately, I've had enough of apps that can only be installed in the phone's limited internal storage. Serious coders ought to know better than to do that.",1
"Great App but one issue. I cannot open images in the answers. I can open the images in Questions and in text of Wikis/Daily Challenges, but not in answers. Please resolve this issue. thank you",4
No proper trial. They want almost 200 before you can get a 7 day free trial. Probably becusse the know ppl might forget to cancel within 7 days. That's very sketchy. If your app was good then you wouldn't have to gouge money.,1
It's an incredible brilliant application for those who wants to learn Important courses that can improve non bullsh*t app I have ever seen and absolutely for free. Go ahead ->,5
"I have had more fun with this application/website and its refreshing all the memories that I had in college, and all the memories that I had before I died for 15 minutes. Interestingly enough, I was a Genius before I died in 2012, and now With this system I know that I am going to get my genius status back. Thank you creators and designers at school nation point",5
"The app is great however the free trial is to short (only a week) and the premium subscription is way to expensive, if it cost half as much I would definitely buy this but it's not so I will not be paying for the premium",3
I like paying games and different sets of exercises for my brain. I didn't enjoy math in high school but this apps is quite helpful in trying to understand some of the basics that I lacked.,5
Well brilliant has helped me Understand and not just memorize equations and helped me a lot. I got to knew it when kuruzkasagt a youtube told me about it. It has helped me greatly and is worth the price.,5
Great learning app i highly suggest it if you're willing to put about 24 dollars a month for a subscription. The only bad thing about this app is that you can't just restart a whole corse. You can only restart a lesson.,4
worst experience ever. I have paid for yearly subscription but still all courses are locked. I have sent about 5 emails but no response. kindly look into it. Or at least initiate refund,1
I'm a self taught data analyst dabbling in data science and machine learning. This app is super fun and useful to use on the train commute or something to use other than social media apps(doom scrolling).,5
"This is probably the most fun way I've had to learn new useful knowledge. I have the app for my phone. So instead of checking social, youtube or some streaming services ""I play a few lessons'' I say play because this app makes learning feel like a game.",5
Great tool for refreshing the stuff I loved in school but haven't thought about in 15 years. Definitely enjoying the mental exercise and the non-academic approach to talking about things.,5
I don't see dark mode option in this app.,4
The app get really bad when tackling advanced mathematics. Everything gets confusing not much explanation is given and the practice exercises are basically non existent.,2
"Brilliant is the best app I have ever found. It teaches you math like kindergarden a,b,c,d it explains in so much details. U will start loving math and science. I really appreciate the founder for making such app that helps people without taking any fee. :⁠-⁠)",5
"an exyremely good app. sooooooooooooo educatibe. im logging in every day for MONTHS. i do the daily challemges, which are so nicely placed on a subject of either math or science. a very good app, ot provided very interactive courses amd is very good for exams. i highly recommed this to anyone looking for extra info and courses. all my friends use it too",5
Absolutely loving it !! i came across many tutorials but this one is the best and motivating to learn something new. Brilliant idea. Aspiring to become a better coder and this one is helping me in the process.,5
Best app for jee advanced toppers and making the basics as advanced. But it is costly. I bet with the owner of this app that if he free the app from cost than the students taking coaching will not go there but study on this app. Really as its name suggests it is really brilliant.😘😘😘😘,4
"The app is built very beautifully and has taken lot of efforts but 4,800 Rs per year subscription? If you are really the one who is interested in science and mathematics then you will buy a book from store with that money and it will be more worth of it. The real geniuses out there have read and solved lot of books📚 and not learned from such apps. You are fooling yourself if you are getting happy after solving such easy questions, take a JEE book and then you will feel the real joy.",5
Not Free. Education should be free. Great experience using this platform for however little time it was available as a free trial. Rating 1 star only because everything gets locked in a paid subscription bundle.,1
"It's a good app , makes concepts clear but nothing is organised; i mean a lot of topics are skipped and the courses directly jumps to advanced. And i m sry to say that max things are premium",4
It is a great experience. I wish I had it when I was in school. I highly recommend it for those interested in really understanding.,5
"I can't find what I want or check what they have, because they literally have no search function... I tried browsing through their courses, but i couldn't find any of the stuff they talked about in the ad. Ridiculous.",2
Would be better if Brilliant did not spam emails and messages multiple times each day.,2
"Amazing app, 💯% recommend thought it would be another one of those scratch ripoffs, was totally misinformed.",5
Sends emails and pushes despite being turned off in options. Immediately uninstalled.,1
Really helped me out when I was new to computer science,5
I love it the app I like to improve my mathematic bc it's my hardest subject for me and also so interesting and I enjoyed and I used alot and thank you so much 💗👌,5
"If i have this app when i was highschool i was living a different life now, now i realise all i need was a good teacher, thanks for your great app",5
"The short, sequential lessons are effective at guiding understanding of abstract concepts",5
They're serious when they say that interactive learning is 6x more effective.,5
It's very easy to use and fun learning. It makes learning easy and fun.,5
Really nice but I'd appreciate if we had a way we could expansate on a certain rule or formula overall this app deserves 5 stars,5
Amazing app!! Only reason I give it a 4/5 is I wish they had more topics to choose from.,4
"I really love this app. The lessons are simple and to the point, not overly complicated.",5
"Brilliant is... Indeed brilliant for learning, i love it, makes it so simple and easy to learn, and the interactive visuals really help to understand the concepts.",5
"I'm still learning mathematics at this age and I'm loving it thru this Brilliant Apps, Superb 👍👍👍👍👍",5
Never had I ever interacted with my studies before brilliant. It was always a dream of mine and it came true.,5
"Best app ever, i suggest you to download it",5
Absolutely love this app. Because I have learned a lot in the last couple of days since I've been using it I've been out of school for nearly 13 years now. And there's a lot of things that I've been wanting to learn and catch up on. Because I want to go to college in the future. And I really strongly feel like this app will help me do so. So please keep doing what you're doing. I love the app and I recommend it to all others as well ESPECIALLY YOUNG CHILDREN!!! Thank you and well done everyone!,5
"It is perfect, but I think it would be awesome if it had an offline option.",5
Honestly very helpful for me I have no idea about coding and it's been a great help,5
"Really great app, thank you. I easily remember school Maths with it.",5
Brilliant has taught me more in 1 week than 10 years of public school.,5
"The continue button doesn't always work when in a course. Have to restart and do that puzzle again. The courses are interesting, however.",2
It's a very good APP because it gives the best educational resources.,5
"I'm a pretty smart person in my own words. But every now and then, it's humbling to tackle a field that you're not familiar with. Brilliant gives me that feeling on a daily basis which only makes me hungrier for knowledge and want to keep getting smarter everyday.",5
"If you have any experience with programming, do not download this app. It has illogical logic. And half of their programs do not make sense.",2
I like the challenges and the interactive style of teaching,5
Always a brilliant way to learn something new in math and science.,5
Amazing. Feels way more productive than scrolling through my phone.,5
Great app to keep your brain cells active and fit.,5
This is really fun and I'm learning math I missed out on when I dropped out of highschool,5
Amazing & well engineered app. Great for building problem solving skills,5
"Simple, elegant direction. Excellent GUI.",5
"I really like the discussion forums, but most of all, a nice variety of interesting math puzzles, both challenging and attractive/engaging. Thanks!",4
"App does not load in my gmail account, some thing is wrong same on web version",1
I've struggled with algebra all my life and I'm actually learning more than I ever did in school!,4
Brilliant app is easy to navigate and help me learn.,5
It's a very good app to learn math and anything other about science or programing,5
Fun to learn stuff. Wanted to learn python but stayed for more knowledge 😄,5
Yay so glad they decided to add a monthly payment option!,5
App is very nice. As a mature student coming back to uni its nice to have as many ways to learn as possible. I just I wish there were more chemistry and an option for a dark mode for studying at night.,5
Best interactive educator. Hope more courses get added.,5
The best and the most interesting learning application period,5
Very fun addictive learning experience in various fields.,5
best app for learning maths and science creatively.,5
"Brilliant! Very well named, can't think of a better adverb. I have yet to really dive deep into this, but saved for my 2 kids in lower secondary school. Hey will definitely benefit from this.",5
"It's really great, but the pro version is too expensive... I wish adding another way of accessing the whole course, like the first place in the league wins a free whole course for example",4
"Great app, although some of the questions aren't all that thorough and well worded. But definitely helps you blitz through STEM as a complementary source.",5
Nice looking amd intuitive app. Courses are well made and give you hints about things that you might find useful/interesting. Unfortunately there are some minor bugs so I cannot give 5 starts :(,4
A great and very low stress way to sharpen your skills. I do a little every day and each lesson sticks with me. I am seeing improvement in just a few days.,5
"Amazing STEM learning app. I've been hooked, the learning progression and gamification are out of this world. I'm from the computer sciences area and the contents are just immaculate.",5
"They seemed to have gotten rid of the free daily challenges, which is a shame. It's the only app I'd found that had good quality puzzles.",3
Super engaging and not naggy or obtrusive. Easy to just take a quiz or 3 when you have a moment. Number 1 app for when you're taking a dump - engage your brain instead of rotting it with instagram etc,5
"It has amazing concepts and explanations. Not just in one field of study, but various fields with various topics to cover. I would recommend it to others too.",5
Love the content & format- complex concepts explained in a fun & interesting manner. Highly recommended for growth minded people of all ages. Slightly expensive but really worth spending a few extra bucks.,5
"Smoothly flowing course, well structured, carefully planned, clear typography and diagrams. The least painful and most accessible math course I've ever taken.",5
Scam. How did I get two annual subscriptions? I really hope you die a painful death. Update. A refund request (from Google purchase history) for one plan got approved instantly. The second charge cannot be refunded by Google because 'it doesn't meet our policy'. So now I am gonna refund via my bank.,1
The way of teaching is quite good but not as much outstanding as marketed. And it doesn't justify the high price. If the price was lower I would easily recommend this.,3
"Exceptional learning experience no matter how bad you think you are at math, science, problem solving, etc. The community associated with Brilliant is as exceptional as the app.",5
"Great app to learn something new, but may not appropriate for the complete beginners in math or science because some topics are oversimplified. But it still grate.",5
"As a premium user I rate it 4 stars for not having full complete course. The course are as it's name suggest ""brilliant""! I hope it complete all the courses and add topology and metric space in it. The course it contains are better than university books.",4
"Math is kind of a language. If you don't use it that often or do so partially, you risk forgetting stuff or getting slow. This is a smart and most of all enjoyable way to keep practicing this language.",5
Love the animations super duper good at explaining things and keeps the user very adapted and it's easy to follow along. Highly recommend if you need to get smarterr,5
I can't load the practices anymore. The loading animation just keep running and nothing happens. I'll have to cancel my subscription. It's a shame because I was enjoying the exercises.,1
I think subscription is too expensive for what you get & shouldn't be more than $100 per year. Free version only lets you preview each course and premium costs $150 a year.,3
Only tried 4 lessons yet already understood all of it. It was easy to learn and simple and also has various courses. A very solid learning app.,5
"I enjoyed the journey of six days but after that things changed. The app wouldn't open 📱 **The App's Broken Promise** **Brilliant App** wowed me for seven days. But on the seventh, it crashed. The trial vanished, and I felt cheated. Developers, fix this! 🌟🚀",2
Iove the app. But the python section is giving me a really annoying bug where everytime I input a character it takes me to the top of any given section of code. It's making it really hard to operate.,3
No dark mode. No read aloud feature. I have to login into the app every day. Once I login my credentials don't get saved. And each time that happens my previous sessions downloaded courses disappeare from the offline section.,1
Very interesting and engaging lessons. The app itself is well made. Also like the way it incentivise you to keep learning with points and leagues.,5
"This is a slick program with a ton of information. But, I had tried to cancel and thought I had but still got charged for renewal. I can't afford it so I was hoping for a refund. Could someone please help.",4
"Updated to respond to dev: thanks, it happened again and I did report it thru Shake. I'll keep moving thru the puzzles and see if it happens again. If it was just a weird one off, I'll definitely revise my rating.",2
first time i heard this thing AND THIS THING ITS VERY VERY VERY GOOD FOR ME!!!!!! FIVE STAR FOR YOU! I GOT THIS THING FROM ELECTROBOOM AT YOUTUBE! 100% MOST RECOMMEND! im kind of faking the age sorry if i lie to you:( just want to test BUT ITS GOOD😊,5
"Great service with abysmal sales scheme. 9.99/month of you pay annually or 24.99/month if you pay per month. Sorry, but you can piss right off. Even 9.99/month is over priced considering what other things I have for that kind of money.",2
"Garbage service, I had accidentally purchased the one year subscription and requested a refund. They say they can offer a refund under certain circumstances. And denied me... they will hustle you for your money.",1
"Best of the best Learning app in the whole world, as the name itself implies it's meaning-""BRILLIANT"" , I just love this app, it is helping me all types of studies from Computer Science to Geometry , you can also use this learning app as an fun and more exciting way...",5
"I had an unfortunate misunderstanding with the billing however the customer support and outreach team were supportive and knowledgeable. Top tier experience with this company, superior product and complete package.",5
The interactive exercises are amazing and the explanations are way beyond the contemporary textbooks.,5
Excellent app! BEST EVER and simply fantastic for developing math aptitude!!! One request - Please free it from being Internet-dependent for all questions and unlock all the challenge levels.,5
"Great app for learning. Engaging, useful, and a great way to pass time while learning something new. They have daily challenges if you like to challenge yourself while learning something new every day.",5
An excellent app. I'm on the computer science pathway and I've tried learning code before but this course has made it so simple and accessible. Highly recommend!,5
"Awesome brain trainer. I am feeling more ""brainer"" and brilliant than ever before. It really takes you through all the concepts practically experiencing and logically satisfying.",5
"I can't keep quiet and just continue to use it anymore!!! What a wonderful learning experience!! Thank you so much for such a great learning machine for those who want to follow Elon Musk's advice on ""best learning methodology""",5
"Doesn't even let me create an account because ""sorry an error occured please try again later"". Was gonna pay for it but it derailed a potential customer on the first junction. very brilliant",1
"I love this app, the premium, it's fun and makes learning and brushing up a blast. I am setting up a daily schedule to start my self improvement project starting within the month. I love BRILLIANT",5
"I've downloaded this app for 3 times. But every time I want to open course, the app just throw me to the home screen. I enjoyed Brilliant website, and want to use app so much.",3
"It was amazing my 8 year old brain got like Idk like 69IQ to 100IQ. I just like it soooo much but I feel like the full brilliant experience is a little bit too pay2win I mean like £105 that's like half of my pocket money. But it's in my mind one of the best game in my gaming experience! It's like as good like minecraft and stumble guys. honestly the people that put a 1 star, i will give them I big boo. Like wow. How do you make a game that good? Like just if your bro dumb then use this game!!!!!",5
"After they have taken my account information and asked if wanted to buy premium immediately it put up a pop up saying ""that I appear to be enjoying brilliant, and how would I rate the app?"" I have not interacted with the app at all besides giving you my personal information. And .... I appeared to like that and should rate you? This is indicative of a dishonest company, and there's no way I'm ever buying anything because of this experience. Really a bad taste in my mouth, disgusting.",1
"Honestly. I would give it 5 stars and buy a yearly subscription if I could pay the equivalent of a yearly prime membership on Amazon. Not more than that. Knowledge shouldn't cost more than modern day materialism. Thanks, but the price is not good enough. I'll pass.",2
"Really enjoying the refresh from what I covered in school. Something's I remember, others not but the app is very clear and entertaining so I am having fun while learning! :)",5
let me pay monthly not everyone can afford an annual payment 🙃,1
I have the free version and I only do the daily challenges-they are of varying difficulty and great practice for the brain. The trial courses seem pretty nice too,5
As long as you don't mind paying for a premium account Brilliant provides an excellent service for the money. Especially if you can be one of the first 200 to use a sponsored link for the 20% discount.,5
Iv learnt more math through this app then I ever have in school. It focuses on why things are rather then memorizing disconected facts. This is what understanding is! but the difference is rarely emphasized in school.,5
"It is a brilliant app, I really enjoy it",5
"I'm a homeschool student, and while using this app, everything made sense. I've been studying Algebra, and using this app, I studied again what I've studied in the past, and what I thought that has no use, turns out to be useful. This helped me more to understand problem solving.",5
"Best ever learning application and provide the way to reach learning resources. But , unfortunately they are paid that's what make me more curious about some topics .Its my request to the editors of this best app to reduce the paid charges or make them free This would help many people to gather knowledge by your means. And also to continue the humanity",5
"Did the free trial. Content was basic but not useful for me so I cancelled before trial end date, still got charged for a years subscription which apparently can't be refunded even with proof.",1
"i remember when some of the content was free but now everything is paid and it is too expensive for average. clearly the target audience is people in university already studying because they could afford it, so its pointless for the majority.",1
"Does a good job at allowing you to access your Brilliant courses. Nothing your browser couldn't achieve though, apart from the possibility to download courses for offline use.",4
"Clear and clean. The representation is easy for me to capture, cute art, and solving problems along the way makes the lesson more engaging.",5
Sometimes it feels too complicated and find out difficult to motivate myself to do a course. Maybe you can make it more visual or user friendly,3
Great app and great content but it crashes constantly on startup. I have to reinstall it almost daily to get it to work once it starts crashing.,4
Good lessons but not so great UI at times. Sometimes laoding screens stay on the screen and this obscures views of the other content on the screen after loading,4
"My favorite app to practice science. It has been guiding me through my Physics degree, introducing new ways to solve problems and intuitive ideas to efficiently learn concepts.",5
Smooth UI and clear lesson layout. Great way to pass the time instead of playing games or endlessly scrolling the void. Notifications aren't obnoxious and I'm learning new things!,5
"Amazing app!! All kinds of interesting topics, well explained and make it easy and fun to learn. Got here from Kurzgesagt videos and their lessons are great in the app. Very recommended 👌",5
"Great app. I enjoy the in-depth explanation it uses when explaining concepts. Also, with real world examples, I understand and value the usefulness of the stuff I learn.",5
"The app is great, but I got an issue after I bought premium subscription and support team is ignoring me completely. This is extremely frustrating and unexpected.",1
"Not tough to use or navigate, but tough in material. It tries to start you off at a novice stage, but quickly sends you to 1000mph into the learning stage!",5
"Challenging puzzles, usually incorporating ideas with broader application. I find them engaging and a better way to kill time than doomscrolling.",5
"The app is really well thought out, one can brush up on concepts or learn something new any time, anywhere. That's a big value addition.",5
I have paid for the premium version the one that says yearly but its not stable its not good at all i mean it's supposed to work after a couple of hours if there's an error but still the premium version is not working for me.,1
"So far so great, intuitive, comprehensive learning... Some issues with the toggling and the context menus of the python code in android.",4
"I think it has a nice interface, and is interactive enough for students who show strength in bodily-kinesthetic, and visual learning styles.",5
"Honestly, amazing way to fill the moments in the day. Lessons are bite sized and very understandable, and I feel like I'm learning a lot. Highly recommend.",5
"Lots of creative math puzzles, some physics. Unfortunately does not focus so much on critical thinking, mostly setting up imteresting math problems",5
Not satisfied with the free experience. Far too simple and can't move on to serious topics. I have a degree in STEM and don't need to learn what a variable is.,1
Overall this is very user friendly and I love how the lessons are set. I've been in this every day and it's a great refresh or if you are exploring something new,5
"More than half the time when I go to enter an answer, the word 'Unidentified' pop up in the box. Beyond this sizable bug it's a great app.",2
✨Over of the best app under education tag. Neat and clean UI. Fun to learn basic concepts with easy to understand explanation with graphics. Worth investment. 🌟,5
"First, as stated in previous comments, the ""continue"" button in the mobile app stucks sometimes. Second, no feedback for such critical comments is provided. But the content is very interesting and I like it.",4
Good puzzles and well designed user interface. Too bad the free version has so little content and they expect you to pay $120/yr to solve puzzles.,3
Excellent app but subscription fees can't be more disappointing. You need to be rich to learn. Atleast add a student plan or scholarship plan for students who can't afford the app usual fee. And please add Dark mode.,1
Amazing app. It allows you to play concepts to learn and it is the best way. You may get things wrong but the way they explain it allows you understand.,5
"The premium version is too expensive for someone living in India. Why can I just watch ads and unlock courses. Not everyone has the luxury of buying the premium version, even if they really wish to learn.",2
"This was described as free for it's weekly challenges, after which one ""could"" sign up for courses... What a load of BULLSH#T! I'm not made of money! Bugger this for a joke! How about telling the truth - Noone appreciates false advertising!! HONESTY ISN'T THAT HARD!",1
"The limit is 500 hundred characters so I will put it short: I wanted to buy the premium version, but as I opened the app, I saw that the price for annual membership was doubled in a few days and that of annual membership skyrocketed even worse. How can I tell if this app is worth this much money only by viewing the introductions?",1
"The content is perfect, but the app's behavior when reopening is really strange. It never starts where I left off and throws me into quizzes I already finished.",3
"It feels similar to Duolingo, But I'm able to stay engaged and understand the lessons at a quick rate. It does require you to think for yourself though and problem solve",5
My wife bought the app for me as a gift and paid full price. I'm logged in. I am not able to access all the content. The help launches an email. I sent an email. I haven't heard back. I sent another email. Nothing yet.,1
Scroll is broken. The scroll left/right overrides scroll up/down. It's nearly impossible to just scroll down. This is pretty basic functionality for an app. How could it be this bad?,2
"I was expecting a refresher on some old imformation as well as to learn something new, but even with the Fundamental Math course I'm learning new ways to think about even basic math problems.",5
Having so much fun learning science. Helps you spend time on smart things instead of social media and such... Very happy that I found it. It might change my life for better.,5
"Amazing app Very light interface, picks up where I leave even if phone shuts down. No pushy ads. Gets to the point without a lot of blabbering. Nice app to learn concepts on the go.",5
The best brain-trainer!,5
Crystall clear vision on how simple arithmetics step by step turns into beautiful sophisticated riddle solving. Easy and handy set of tricks and technics to make problem solving heuristicaly delightful.,5
"If u are a student, parent or teacher in any level and wanting to take learning or teaching to the next level, this is the app for you. No cap.",5
"It's a pretty good app. But the problem is, I can't begin my problems or courses as it says can't load page. But my internet connection is good. I have checked it. Please fix this issue.",3
"I really enjoy the setup, both in practice and steps for learning. The cost is outrageous and it's disappointing that it is so unaffordable.",4
"i love this so much, entertaining, fun and very creative! i am an easily distracted person, easy to get bored too. but this on had me entertained all the time! the arts are cute and original, i also loved the minimalistic theme. if i could, i'd like to rate 10/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
Really good learning app.,5
Incredible tool for learning,5
Great application for learning otherwise difficult concepts. Great UI update as of recent. I will subscribe to premium once a system based Light/Dark mode is implemented. 👌,5
Love the content and the quizes. I'd recommend paying for pro but you can get a lot without the subscription. I hope they don't have to introduce ads ever.,5
I really enjoy doing the math classes every day with my coffee in the morning. Refreshing my knowledge and challenge myself. Also gives me great ideas how to exlain more complex subjects to my kid while helping with the homeworks :),5
"With Brilliant, you can dive into whatever you want to learn. It gives you deep knowledge with simple explanation. I haven't paid yet. But I am sure this app is worth every penny you pay... Great thanks for every second you spend to imrove Brilliant and our knowledge...",5
"Just awesome UX with cool interactive animations. A lot of interesting topics, but seems a bit to expensive for me. Don't know how far I can go without premium(",5
"My troubles started Nov 28, 2022 when I downloaded & installed the Brilliant app via Google Play Store and chose the 7-day Free trial, followed by Google 's confirmation email. On Dec 1, I canceled the Free trial but the Google confirmation stated that I was canceling my BRILLIANT PREMIUM ANNUAL PLAN THAT ENDS NOV 28, 2023!!? My credit card was charged $162.22. I was using the Free trial so HOW DID I END UP WITH A SUBSCRIPTION??? I ain't happy. I Need that charge removed! Finally got a refund!",5
"Love the app. Math is my way of having fun, can't stop that sentisation of solving equations and this app is perfect for it. Thinking about buying the premium version since even while free it's great.",5
"i like the formulated sessions and quizes it set as challlenging questions. even a would be ""common sense question"" causes me to lose train of thought. braising the notion that i need to focus one task or in this game one question at a time for a direct and correct answer.",5
"There's an infinite loading loop at startup, I am using a pixel 6. The app otherwise is the best one to learn math, but I can't use it on my phone even though I am a subscriber, when this is fixed I will update my review.",1
"Brilliant has opened new doors for my understanding of Physics and Mathematics. I am simply inspired by the effort of the team. I suggest beginners to start from Mathematics Fundamentals, Pre Algebra. THANK YOU, BRILLIANT!!!",5
It is great for a student like me as I always want to find the best possible way to study and then learn something put of it. This is a great app for student or for people who want to go ahead in their learning.,5
"I love the app. It just has such intrigueing courses like special relativity, machine learning and a whole lot of math. Simply put: Awesome!",5
"When I open a lesson in a course, it just shows a blank screen forever. Nothing shows up. Even the downloaded courses does not open. What a waste of money 🤦‍♂️",1
I often start a course and then realise I don't have enough fundemental base skills to understand the questions. Would be better if they had a difficulty to the course.,3
Really convenient app to learn on the go. Various types of mathematical quizzes. It reinforces concepts im currently studying at university.,5
"It' free, it really helps Me lol earn what it is I'm trying to know. I haven't got to use it for a very long amount of time, but as far as I can tell. It's a fantastic learning app. A good tutor! #tutor #math #science #engkish #homeworkhelper",5
"It's a great idea to launch this type course for clearing concepts by using simple quizzes, This course creators are Great!! This is the course I am looking from past 7 years",5
"I bought this app as a general learning enthusiast, and I'm working through the logic section right now! The app makes it easy to learn concepts and I like that it's less reading and more applied practice!",5
Awful dark design. Getting you to signup before telling it's awfully expensive. With such a start I can only expect the rest of the app and content is equally bad.,1
Very awesome information in an easily digestible format. Tons of high quality fresh content. I just wish the app had a dark mode since I like to use it at night,4
"TERRIBLE. I cancelled the free week's trial after a few days and BRILLIANT charged me £130; They refused to answer my numerous requests for 3 days, and when they did, ""couldn't find any record"". Do not recommend.",1
"Kudos on creating such a great app! The concepts of maths and science and computers are presented in depth, with crystal clarity and in a super interesting way!",5
"Bought premium for one year. But still premium courses are not unlocked. It's showing ""Developer hasn't acknowledged your purchase"" Money was deducted immediately. Please help what to do.",1
Not a bad way to review high-school or college level stuff when I want to waste time on my phone. Hoping to see more advanced topics eventually!,5
"Really disappointed with the perpetual decline in the quality of this app that I used to love and use every day. First, they turned off community, and now, in the last year the quality of their questions and answers has declined. I finally uninstalled it. Too bad!",1
I loved the app but I just can't continue using it because you can only do the base level in every course and there is no way I pay for premium that much money even to learn somethings I enjoy like science and math,2
"great app for thought, unfortunately the cost is ridiculous 24.99 per month if you can't afford to shell out 119 to pay for the entire year. I understand a discount for paying up front, but why is there such a outrageous difference? $119 vs $300 ?!?!",3
"A fantastic app, always learning new stuff - helps you see math and science from a fun and interesting perspective so that you can greatly improve at it!",5
"I don't know what in the world i can say the makers.. Seriously guys, i am speechless.. There can be no other app better than this one.. Learning had never been so easy and fun.. At first i thought it was for school kids and then i realized what depth you have dug into.. Salute!!!!!.. If i could rate you 10, i would have done that..",5
"I never did anything in this app. It was accidentally downloaded and my bank was debited by $129.50 for an app I didn't know was on my phone!!!!!!! I am reporting this to BBB, PayPal, and the consumer protection agency for an immediate refund! I am 65 years old and this feels like a scam.",1
"Guys, could you please not reload the screen when activity is resuming. This is starting to be annoying to scroll the same page many times.",4
"I'm very disappointed. There's simply no content. Once I hit the ""start course"" button, nothing appears but empty pages with the word ""explanation"" on them. What the heck is that?",3
Fellow adults! Get your math brain back with this app. I'm making connections to ideas that I haven't thought about in years. The result is that my memory AND concentration have improved. Gains!!!,5
"Plenty of courses, Courses are fun, Easy to switch between devices. Sure a little expensive, but I think it's worth it.",5
Absolutely awesome learning app with a massive list of broad subjects. I did a few levels for free and loved it so I naturally subscribed.,5
Wish my Physics classes had taken this kind of approach. Makes hard concepts easy to learn by connecting them to bite-sized things we already understand in every day life.,5
"Lovingggg itt!! Perfect for any knowledge and personal development seeker. Wish there was a 6 month package, or at least something in between monthly and yearly payments, though. Highly recommended!",5
A really good way to keep your conseptual thinking up to speed! Great presentation of difficult material in a easy and engaging way.,5
"It seemed like an altruistic idea, then once you leave introduction they want you to pay $100 for one year. what a joke. who knows if it works because you'd have to shell out the money just to find out what the actual non introductory content is.",2
"Is excellent that this kind of apps exist, I'm already paying the membership and is totally worth, I'm pursuing a computer science degree and brilliant really help me with my assessments and to understand better what I'm learning.",5
This is what I've been searching for years! Stoked to learn about things I've been thinking about out of the blue. It's easy to keep up with and is perfect if you're a slow learner like myself!,5
"Great, but the price for annual subscription is too much! I understand the quality is excellent, I'm still evaluating and I can't justify spending that much, but I shall see how it stands up as a resource.",5
A fun and interactive way to learn new concepts. The chapters are not too long so you can even progress with limited time on your hands.,5
"Leagues, as in Duolingo, are the worst possible thing for an app. A terrible decision that actively promotes not learning, and I won't stay and watch this app get corrupted like Duolingo has.",1
"Amazing app! I love how Brilliant is working on making learning experience creative and more easier. The premium version is really great! Please keep on adding more topics. To all folks out there, Happy learning:)",5
Has a lot of great puzzles and different ways to learn . Its £17.50 a month though which is terrible value for money considering netflix and amazon prime together cost that,3
"This is a truly eye opening app, with a yeard subscription I'm preparing myself for a masters in engineering and getting my mind right for the future. (This is not the only source of material I use, but it does make me feel like I truly understand something unlike watching a youtube video)",5
"Simply Brilliant! It's how learning should be. Fun, engaging and rewarding. Makes you want to come back for more. It's good to get back to first principles and solidify knowledge.",5
It is an excellent tool i would agree but the examples are sometimes too simple. There should be a way to choose to get harder questions.,4
for the experience it's more than 5 stars but the free version limits to you a very small region . and the premium version is not at all affordable. the pricing is just too high,2
"Liked the way things are explained, but there is no provision of saving notes and aging bookmarks. It would be great to have them to go back to them",4
"I really enjoy the app but can't afford it. A year is basically food for a whole month. This is why we are degrading as a society, apps like Prime and Netflix charge a fraction for mind numbing entertainment.",1
"Worth every penny. Honestly I've learned more in this app than in my actual college level classes, except here it's actually fun, comprehensible, and comprehensive.",5
Not able to check my leaderboard in this version. Pictures don't show up! Bugs Bugs and bugs! It's ironic with the name Brilliant that you guys don't have brilliant app developers!,4
Absolutely love this app. They dont have everything id like to see but there a lot and its all top quality. Aome classes assume you already know basics so it make the course hard,4
"It's a really great app, but it's really frustrating that it doesn't work offline. It would be so much better if I could just have the next 1 or 2 lessons offline.",3
Good app for learning basics and great for brain exercises. It really clears the basic concepts and provides an out of the box insight into a problem.,5
It's an amazing app. I super enjoy it. I'm thankful for all the amazing people and team behind this app. For me it's cost too much. Maybe sometimes if I collect much money in the future I will kindly pay for it.,5
Only one thing i want that Please make it available for night mode and also this could be beneficial for you that on doing so it will increase screen on timing of this app because now people could also read during night . But this app is awesome.,5
I am unable to find my favourite thing about the app is the concept practice problems that I cannot find easily and conveniently. I sought trough my recent activity of the app to find the practice problems those are really helpful.,3
I love this app! The problems and explanations are comprehensive AND easily digestible. It makes me feel so much better about killing time on my phone and still feels fun.,5
Brilliant helps all students learn easy with an amazing interface. Additionally problems can be easily solved by asking for show explanation. Great app for all,5
Fraud app. They gave a permission of 7 days trial. And before the trial the account was deliberately deactivated. And I could not cancel the subscription and my money was deducted. Just cheap trick to loot someone. Pathetic,1
It makes lesrning so easy it barely feels like an accomplishment. Ten days after starting the free trial I feel I won't stop until I'm done with every single course available in the platform.,5
It's actually pretty decent so far I'm learning about math and stuff. Definitely try the 30 day trail to see that it's a well rounded app. I'm definitely going to continue with the membership.,4
I am from India and when I tried to subscribe the amount I was shown was 4800 dollars.. Didn't feel the amount right.. I guess it should have been 4800 rupees.. Didn't proceed because of the confusion.. Would be good to check that... So that others don't get confused like me.,1
"Excellent! I wish I can purchase the premium version, but looks like I have to stick with the free version. If free version can offer this much, then I can only imagine what premium version could offer.",5
"Makes refreshing long lost skills a joy. To date, every attempted topic has been explained clearly, using first principles and easy to understand examples. Would recommend wholeheartedly to any lifelong learners out there",5
"I am retired and never had a good maths education. Brilliant has brought me up to a respectable level of mathematics and programming, now I can enjoy this rapidly changing world.",5
"Very nice and challenging, of course it depends on the topic. Other part is decerning exactly the point in sentence in Logic course, cause I am not native English speaker.",5
"Pricing is not transparent. i bought one year membership. then the site offers lifetime at 384. when you really click to buy it, the price changes subtle to 437.",1
"Good, but, difficult phrases. May be, diffivult words can have an optional pop up for meaning or something. But, overall, very good.",5
"I got an email subscription scam, I never installed this app. And now they send me email updates. To unsubscribe I have to login with my accounts. This sounds a scam I will not login my sensitive data could be stolen. Please check immediately what is going on here",1
Math has never been my subject history has been but after finding this app and ignoring the countless youtube sponsorship ads I finally folded and downloaded it. it's great colorful and simple to follow. Five stars,5
Really Interesting Concept. And the app works well in mobile. Its easier to navigate and follow the questions. Font sizes are good.,4
"I love how easy Brilliant explains everything. It's very interactive and it's an amazing and fun way to learn Math, Physics, Computer science! I love it",5
Please state this app requires a subscription before you download it. Might well be very good but hiding it's a subscription service is just a cheap move. In app purchases are not the same as a subscription,1
life changing app.. I studied applied math in college but am learning so much here every step of the way.. so much effort has gone into making it easy to use and now math can be part of my every day life easily.. thank u all!,5
Good App for building mental capacity,5
"Refreshing high school maths, i want to get a BS on Computer Science so I must be prepared to dont struggling during math classes",5
"For a free app, it really teaches you a lot. Considering the amount of features they have in the free version, I don't think I need to get the premium version",4
"Love brilliant, but the 2 stars are for unexpected app performance. Clicking on the notification doesn't open the app. Fix needed please.",2
"No viewing settings. No pinch and zoom, no font size selection. Still doesn't have the dark theme :/ not quite the level of a paid app.",3
The price point to open content other than the intro subjects is far too expensive ($160/year!). You could buy much more content on other platforms at the same price. Uninstalled,1
"Brilliant IS the Best Platform you can get for learning something new or just for fun, no matter in which class you are which ever topic you choose you will master it, SUCH A GOOD TEACHING METHOD IT USES that you blend in it and never wanna leave. Also you will not regret if you have gone for PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP, as doing it will be like unlocking true beauty of world in a matter of seconds.",5
"The subscription is so damn expensive. Don't know what crowd it is targetted at. If it's subscription, it has to be affordable. Even if it is one time payment, it has to come down. Uninstalled.",1
Sometimes the app doesn't save my progress and sometimes it resets some modules I've already seen (at least they look like have been reset) nontheless a great overall experience,5
"It is really good. I'm giving 4 stars because of the price. Way too much expensive: almost 100 euros per year, discount included! For the rest, it is really great. I love it!",4
"Best app for the people who really want to expand their intellect till date. Great UI/UX design. Amazing work on content. In short, best I have ever come across.",5
"In this day and age you really ought to have a tablet mode. Tens of millions of tablets are sold every quarter. What are you waiting for? Your poll say your customers don't use tablets? When we see no tablet mode, WE DELETE THE APP. Will you app devs WAKE UP and release a TABLET app already. Sickens me. Really does. This ought to be PRIORITY #1. Frankly we are all sick of this. The world is BUYING TABLETS. Hello, BIG landscape screen. It's not 12.4"" telephone.",2
"This app is as the name suggests, brilliant. It is incredibly useful in learning a lot of information in a small amount of time. I would rate them 10/10. Thanks team brilliant 😊. Please add offline mood as well.",5
They quietly renew your membership and take your money with not even an email or reminder. I only found out this year because my card on file expired and then they decided to write saying they couldn't get payment. Sneaky and shady business practice.,1
"Not a good learning tool. I was expecting to learn basic principles of logic and building stronger foundations so I could apply it in real life. Instead all I got was problems to solve, but no tools to solve them with. I'd rather read a good book on logic and critical thinking that use this. Why not teach fallacies, argumentation or abstract reasoning?",1
It goes extremely in depth and allows you to go at your own pace. Creating an environment where you can excel quickly while having fun.,5
This is just Amazing. Whenever I think to just polish my Brain Brilliant helps me. Its just an awesome App related to Mathematical concepts to Physics and Chemistry.❤,5
"Educational, interactive challenges. Explanations are done step by step. Learning a lot and hopefully keeping my mind sharp! Great fun.",5
"A fun, engaging way to learn about the world. Would be an easy 5 stars if it was a bit cheaper for premium and had a dark theme.",4
Well organized and very interactive. I like the way they have developed the app making it more practical to learn about science and mathematic theories and concepts.,5
"Really good app for education, love the lesson layouts",5
"I was fed up with wasting time with social media, so I looked for something to educate me while also entering. This app is great as in giving simple explanations to complex tasks. Give it a try.",5
"Amazing app. I truly enjoy the UI, and the content. The delivery of the lessons are amazing! Very clear, and flows really well. I wish I started sooner!",5
"Wen't for a free trial, and it charged me with one year subs... I do have a verification to autherize payments, but it just never asked it just got paid... and google said I cant have a refund, so be aware... it is a scam",1
The app which I was looking for.Perfect app for problem solvers! You can practice with so many courses available. Definitely will recommend to all,5
I love this app. It has all the courses for an engineering student. Plus it holds courses for undergraduates too. Every course collapses into a range of levels which make studying interesting.,5
The information is accurate and the puzzles keep you engaged. Linking one concept to the next is some brilliantly. One of the few services I don't mind paying for,5
"I am 9 Years old and so far it's not going to bad. It's a funy way of doing mathematics! But the only problem is i can't get a subscription, I asked my parents but they said no. I hope we can unlock more stuff since I use this usually.",4
I've got what I've been wanting since long. This app is suitable for all enthusiasts irrespective of their ages or class. It is like a boon for those who want to contest in the competitions of international or national level.,5
"Amazing learning app. Only downside would be a missing ""unlimited practices"" section. What happened to some of the courses, ""integral calculus"" for example? Thank you",5
"There are only 80 courses NOT thousands. Some courses require a detailed prior knowledge. Honestly I can't recommend this. You're better off with textbooks, or online resources like Khan Academy.",1
Possibly the most engaging way to learn scientific and mathematical concepts you're ever going to find. Genuinely addictive.,5
Auto payment is frustrating. Plz give the option to stop auto payment in apps setting section. Overall app is ossm. Everyone has this app for developing scientific approach towards life.,5
"confusing directions, poorly defined. I find the Brillant app a waste of my time. I cancel my subscription to Brillant.",1
"Bitesized learning with practice. Some little complaints, but they have always deserved 5 stars for the mission and execution.",5
"Great, but bugs out sometimes and won't open. Sits at the loading screen indefinitely until uninstalled and reinstalled",4
One of best apps to learn STEM so far . I will recommend my friends this app. I loved all courses customised according to individual learning .,5
"I love using brilliant, it makes one more informative & more confident about his choice of course.",5
Wonderful experience for learning STEM subjects. Highly visual learners will benefit especially!,5
"The courses and problems should be customized to user level. It's obvious and it's not that way... It's okay, but not more than that.",3
"Fun puzzles and questions, and the explanations are good. But be prepared to pay quite a lot of money if you want to do more than just the introduction chapters.",3
"Awesome. I like this way to learn: no long lectures, no wastefull explanations, brief introduction and practice. Briiliant way to improve the skills :)",5
The best email spam I ever subscribed to. Simple examples building gradually understanding in complex subjects. Strongly recommended for everyone.,5
Scrolling is an impossible mission and some graphs doesn't appear. Python code also runs too slow. Please fix this issues and I'll put 5 stars. Fixed. Great team,5
Pretty good. But its a subscription based service and the $9 a month is just way overpriced imho. $4-5 would fit the bill.,3
Education made easy and simple to understand,5
"Puzzles in the logic section are way too easy, and half way through the first lesson it just stops with no way to continue. A dead end.",1
This App is amazing. The daily problems are fun. The solution system that is set up is incredible and it really helps one learn and understand,5
Beautifully structured and illustrated lessons that allow you to progress at your own pace. Learning has never been so much fun.,5
"Nice app which lays out paths to learning well. Can be a bit irritating at times, I would like to see more subjects on it.",5
"Brilliant could be the best app to sharp/hone our skills in Mathematics, Computer science, and other courses I strongly suggest this app to everyone who wants to pursue the dive into the pursuit of learning👍❤️",5
Simple and fun,5
Tried the app. Was charged for a premium subscription even though i canceled. There is no customer service. Good luck trying to contact them.,1
"The courses seem ok, but the price they're asking is insane. Unless you buy a full year during the initial period for 120 dollars it costs 25 dollars a month. That's crazy for any service, there are better ways to get this knowledge",2
Good for concept understanding,5
"This is an excellent learning app. A great variety of topics are covered. Easy explanation provided, awesome questions, perfect for all ages",5
"the content is great but the app always looses reading position when you switch out of it while multitasking, it is very annoying.",4
"Overall, it's an enjoyable experience for me, but I can't afford it to go premium (it's very expensive in Malaysia). Maybe make it more affordable for the students to use the app freely.",4
"Great method of demonstrating practical applications of abstract ideas to give you an intuitive understanding of mathematical concepts, rather than the school approach of just making you memorise formulas to plug into questions to be forgotten after the test.",5
"Hi when I hit on start course for Scientific Thinking, it just shows me a blank screen. Same when I click on the first module in Introduction. Please suggest a fix.",1
"This is the one of the best education app available in play store. There are many course related to maths , physics and computer science.",5
Was an engaging and fun way to learn. I had to cancel due to time constraints at the moment but definitely will be looking to it in the future again!,5
"It's fantastic in the way it breaks down how it came too conclusions. Additionally the manner in which it guides you to make assumptions is fun and for myself, intuitive.",5
Love this app! Definitely worth the annual subscription (I used the 20% off deal) We do the courses daily.. makes math/science easy and fun to learn!,5
"Very well curated learning topics, delivered in bute-sized chu ks that are easy to engage with. I have tried a few apps like this and Brilliant is definitely the best so far.",5
Love the new Brilliant. Great lessons and activities to learn something new or revisit old concepts. I hope there will me more content available in the near future 🙏.,5
I canceled my account with this service multiple times and i keep getting charged for like 2 years now. Why? I need my full refund. You keep charging me after i already canceled the service after the trial. Thats a couple hundred dollars now. C-mon,1
"Very expensive membership, unsure if it is worth it. Free version is very bare bones. Well designed app, so two stars for the puzzles and format.",2
It's an educational app. It's very helpful in developing concepts. And also one can learn to solve a variety of questions through it. I love it.,5
I uninstalled after the 50th time Brilliant asked me a question that has a completely arbitrary answer I can't possibly know unless I guess wrong first or just ask for it. This app is useful but really frustrating sometimes.,4
"Learning new things is made simple. With this app I always have felt the value of having the paid version. The amount of work that is constantly put in, is very apparent.",5
"So far it's great. I've got goals, and understanding the math is critical... The app is a trusted resource at this point. Try to use it every day and no issues.",5
An excellent app to refresh your basic mathematics and physics and also to inculcate the spirit of visualising and understanding enjoyably in kids than rote learning. The pricing could have been subsidized for students.,5
This is NOT a free app. You have to pay to access anything and it's expensive. The app is decent but there are lots of issues especially with the explanations - they are very difficult to understand.,2
This app has just a simple one tap start to learn anything you wanted ever in order to be brilliant. No more procrastination.,5
"It is pretty cool, but too expensive. Khan Academy is free and also delivers high quality content, with a little less sugar and cosmetics though.",3
Easy to follow and smooth learning style!,5
"Actually, i want to give this app 5-star review, but when i use this app for several days, i realised that this app wasn't completely free and you have to upgrade to premium if you want to fully learn a course and if you not upgrade it, you have to satisfied with introduction-only course",3
"I enjoy the varied math puzzles. I also appreciate the revealable explanations, especially when I don't solve the puzzle myself.",5
30+$ a month!? Charging three times the amount per month compared to a yearly subscription is disgusting. The free trial doesn't allow you access to all the features.,2
"Best application I have ever used for education . Everything I saw in this app is absolutely marvelous . Just make sure not to spoil things with other fields of studies . We do not get enough help in engineering studies . So , in a word , I would like to give this app a 5-star .",5
An absolutely fantastic tool for learning complex scientific concepts in such an easily digestible format that even a six-year old could grasp.,5
"Absolutely terrible customer service. I purchased a gift subscription, the subscription was not sent to the recipient, we sent a mail to the support inbox, and we're still waiting on a response 10 days later.",1
"Animations ,course design is just perfect but problem is very high cost subscription. No on can afford and material is available on web easily too",2
"I think the setup for learning is very good, and the gamification gives you a very interesting sense of progression.",5
"I really like the interactivity and the explanations, versus Khan Academy videos, or lectures on YouTube that take hours to watch with bad audio.",5
Price hikes every year... used to be able to pay under 75 US dollars with the 20% off. Now that same discount will get you a 120 dollar price tag... even with the statewide curfew... I mean it would have been nice to use during thr curfew but 120 is just too expensive,1
"It is a very nice app to provide education with well- defined pictures, which helps us to understand the concepts easily.",5
Great service. If you have friends or family who would enjoy it or benefit from it (like kids) I'd definitely recommend it. I'm a young adult using it myself but wish I had this when I was younger.,5
Great Questions to stay sharp provides lots of good ideas for classes. also love the stimulation of thought this provides. every human with a phone should be using this regularly. why? its free knowlesge!,5
The app is wonderful and helps you learn such a wide range of topics intuitively..(as an added bonus it also helps you face competitive exams),5
They charge a lot because they pay a lot for advertising themselves on every second video on YouTube... Shame... I would have payed otherwise. We don't need an app to learn! Knowledge is free these days!,1
"All 60+ courses are exceptional!Great if you like learning!it's an excellent source for learning math, computer science, science and more!",5
This app is brilliant! Full of great puzzles and teasers! My favorite teaser is the one where they show me monthly price and I want to pay it but can't afford it.,5
"Brilliant - it's in the name! Really enjoying these courses, learning and having fun. The gameification keeps me engaged and on track. Well done, devs and designers!",5
Phenomenal way of learning. Seriously considering buying the yearly plan of this app! Really helps me keep my mind busy after finishing high-school.,5
It is very helpful app . You can find interesting topics to learn. You can learn a lot in effective way if you keep on digging into this but you have to keep up your interest.😇😇😇😇,5
So far has been able to introduce me to a lot of new concepts. I have been taking courses related to computer science in an effort to learn something new and so far it has done great!,5
"Great app, design, and learning regiment that makes it easy to refresh my memory on old math and science lessons while advancing to new ones.",5
This is a subscription scam. You can't actually use the app without paying a $130 subscription fee. I just wanted to catch up on my algebra before I start my college courses.,1
"Great app when you are all about maths and science. Really helps understand concepts better , you don't even need lectures when you got this app. It's a teacher in your pocket",5
This kind of apps are the ones necessary to make the kids more and more interested in learning amazing faxmcta and science based knowledge. I thank the developers and encourage everyone to download this app and learn something new.,5
Best app for learning science and mathematics.,5
A highly engaging and intellectually stimulating pastime that facilitates the acquisition of new knowledge and the refinement of previously acquired abilities. It provides both enjoyment and a sense of accomplishment.,5
"It is very buggy, sorry we pay money for it, make it work. Search list is rendered with empty list elements. Sent screenshots to support email.",1
This is an awesome application. Really helps me improve my math knowledge,5
Intuitive and approachable tool for learning or refreshing your math skills. The interface is sleek and beautiful.,5
"Absolutely love this app. The content, the interface, and most importantly the experience are all incredible.",5
"Overall an amazing and revolutionary app. But I don't need to say that, this app is a go-to and a staple for the majority of all educational communities on youtube. If you're a curious mind, then this app is a no-brainer!",5
"LOVE the content That aside, there are many many bugs in the new interface, specifically on the Google Pixel 3. Please fix, then your app will be at 100% maximum awesomeness 👍🏻",2
"I did not find the free 30 day trial that was there. It was my only chance of getting premium. Either put that button back or give me free premium. End of sentence, 1 star. 😡😡😡",1
Bhands down the best way to instill concepts in your brain in a way you enjoy.,5
I really like these kinds of puzzles and they are written in great quality. It's really easy for me to understand the tasks and what the goal is. Only thing I miss is a dark mode.,5
It is very fun but I kinda wish that it was free like Duolingo...,3
Cannot login with Google account in app as Google blocked it with error msg: You can't sign in from this screen because this app doesn't comply with Google's secure browsers policy. The premium subscription fee is high too.,2
Absolutely love the app but the biggest 2 essential improvements I would make would be to make a dark mode and make it free for students.,4
I couldn't do anything because I'm 10 and it said no but I am a good engineer,5
After asking so many questions it asks for payment,1
"great app, encourages learning and understanding of maths and science and related topics. also promotes keeping one's mind active with daily challenges, and this is only the free modules.",5
Awesome app so far (10 days).,5
"Best app for learning. Thanks team for a brilliant effort, so that no one is left behind in understanding math and science.",5
Explained well and easy to learn.,5
"A great way to learn and relearn things, it's such a shame that there's so much content hidden behind a pay wall.",2
A wonderful app to learn!! 😎,5
"Simplified lessons for complex topics. In a nutshell, it is simply amazing.",5
"I'm sad):, because when you complete a few courses YOU NEED TO PAY TO CONTINUE!im older 7, I JUST WANT TO LEARN):! But I still love this.",5
"Yeah it's the best one I've ever seen, but I had that one problem I can only play 1 chapter in every course...",2
Excellent app to keep your mind agile and sharp,5
This app is brilliant hahahah did u get the joke,5
One of the best apps in the play store. Love the UI and very effective. I learned all topics covered in 3 weeks at my school in 1 day,5
"They advertise 30 days trial with some YouTubers, but when you install the app you only get 7. They don't have a single real human on the support channel, only AI that gives you the dumbest excuse ever which is the trials are platform dependent. Imagine having AI implementation but not a cross-platform trial code LMAO 👏🏽 good job developers",1
Can we PLEASE get a dark mode for the mobile app?,4
Best app !!! I have ever found 🥳🥳🥳,5
This is the perfect doomscrolling killer for me,5
I recommend this is the best.no need to explain.just try it.,5
i have learned a lot with this app,5
Why in the world is there no dark mode?!?!,1
Love the new UI,5
why is it 180 a year no one has 180 dollers,1
When are the ads stopping?,4
Very cool and helpful,5
Good for learning,5
"Excellent, so far.",5
A quite brilliant app,5
Great free version,5
The clue is in the name!,5
Charged me twice for a year,1
Incredible courses and a nice UI. The only thing that could be better for this app is an integrated Dark Mode.,5
"Even the free to access content is an intuitive learning style. I find it more lucrative, intellectually, than the classic method used at school in the UK.",5
"Easy to use, great exercise for my brain and I'm learning lots of concepts that I either missed/misunderstood or never learned when I was in school.",5
Really fluid app experience. The white design makes it very easy to read in any brightness setting. Great content as well,5
Really a very good apps for learning by simulating. But should keep some scope for student specially from third world country for learning freely or at minimum cost.,4
"Still don't like the cartoony and monochromatic design changes, I liked better when it had a colorful design. Please revert it or at least put an option to switch to.",3
Thank you so much for providing such a wonderful educational experience! 😁💖,5
"The interactive elements are buggy showing the worng items to choose from. When you download the courses offline, the images become missing and layout breaks.",3
"Loving brilliant...user friendliness, simplicity, and easy explanations. Also, great little bite-size chunks...totally new approach to learning. Thanks folks!",5
I love learning and man this is nice. Can be addicting to the puzzle solving types but it's nice if you want to learn stuff in a continual fashion,5
"Worst thing ever, it's for total idi*ts! And once you put your card there, they are trying to charge me 126 euros... completely lost app...",1
"Good app, nice content and practise queations. Only disappointment was that we have to purchase many courses, not all are free. Otherwise its a good learning app.",4
Please add the topics of the courses of quantum objects soon!! Studying has become more enjoyable! Thanks to the whole team of brilliant. Keep it up.,5
"Even simple scrolling is sticky and buggy. This app is painful to interact with. Web version works fine on mobile, so why bother with the app.",1
"a very well made app, and a pretty good way of teaching. I'll see how I feel once I've utilized the many things Brilliant offers.",5
"Very useful service in general and works well on mobile, however it's very buggy on my desktop version, and can't seem to get it to work at all on it.",4
Excellent and fun learning tool! Highly recommend for anyone interested in refining their problem solving ability.,5
The one star isnt referring to the app quality. I placed it to say I dont see an option to delete my account which will result in annoying emails I'm assuming. A deception indicator from the beginning.,1
"The app is pretty cool but needs to introduce/improve following features: Dark mode, Comments on every quiz (much like sololearn app) for interactive learning, Some bugs should be fixed.",4
A great app for learning. I just started learning python and this app has made my journey a smooth one with their interactive easy-to-learn courses!,5
"Everything's perfect, from concepts to quizzes. App runs smoothly without lagging, also there are no annoying adds and notifications.",5
Exceptional. I like the tutorial progression. It's fun and easy to grasp the concept behind a principle. 👍😍,5
A well designed and articulated system for exploring fundamental knowledge of science and mathematics. Also very fun!,5
"For short, amazingly good application 5 stars. But for a 1 month they want 16€? Like what. That's a bit too much. It's really expensive. You got free version but only first chapter. Then it's paid.",2
"The new update doesn't even let me read a whole slide. When I try to scroll down, the App immediately sends me to the next page.",1
"Just fastastic app to learn maths, programming and science. Also it has contest maths which is very helpful for me as i am preparing for olympiad. Recommended.",5
"Overall, the app usually works pretty well. The last few days it doesn't work at all. Even uninstall and reinstall isn't enough to fix it.",4
Unusable due to super slow load time. Can't get the app to start. Edit: no fix received for very long time. Finally decided to just reinstall to fix it,1
Will this app make you a mathlete? No Will it turn you into a knockout mathematician? Not on its own. What it does extraordinarily well is explaining the why. Why does Pythagoras' theorem work? Why is the circumference of a circle πd? It helps get down to the why in an extremely interactive way which helps understanding massively. It doesn't hand you an answer it simply asks what you think a solution could be and helps you to understand the why it is or isn't this way,5
"I would have given five stars because I loved the content, but when l tried to take premium l was unable to pay even after trying from multiple times from different devices. So, please help me.",1
The learning experience is very entertaining and fun. I could memrise things more and more. Studies has been improving a lot. My mom approves of it.,5
"The app is pretty good. If you forget to unsubscribe from the free period charges you and no refund is possible. Dissatisfied, such a good app hiding behind their policy if you make the mistake to forget.",1
"This app is brilliant, literally! I would have given it 5 stars, but the fact that I need I pay to continue learning annoys me. Although it is understandable as to why I need to pay, I would have gladly paid if I could.",4
"Struggling to give them money. The premium subscription process is a buggy mess with server errors aplenty Jumping ahead is broken, it will keep going back to the first unsolved node",2
"I think it's great and all, but I doesn't seem to show the puzzles as a whole image, like with this one puzzle in logic involving 3 boxes, it's only showing one",4
"""Brilliant app is a game-changer in education, offering engaging courses from math to art. Its vibrant community fosters collaboration and support. With seamless navigation and regular updates, it's the go-to for anyone seeking knowledge and connection.""",5
"I love it, sometimes a bit abstract and challenging. Sometimes simple and relational. It's the best way to improve!",5
I paid for the year's subscription on accident but I like the app so much that I kept.It's helping me get a better perspective on stuff that I didn't catch the first time through in my recent college studies.,5
it's a really cool app if you want something that helps boost your critical thinking skills. I use it before class starts to help get me in the thinking mindset. 👍🏻,5
Misleading. Makes it seem like the app is free. It's not. 7 days then it charges you $150!!! You read that right. $150. Absolutely terrible pricing and manipulation of potential customers all to gain their data.,1
"Awful. No explanation when you don't understand something. It's like being back at school with a smug teacher who can't be bothered to help and just yells the same rubbish louder, like that should make you understand. Avoid this app.",1
"Amazing app!!!!! It is a really good way to spend time,but spending it for a really good reason. It will give you a general way of understanding things with puzzles and redels to solve,. So try this app,really good app.",5
"The last update has made it really hard to navigate around the app. It used to be easy to move between the daily problems, the summary page and courses.",3
"This app is teaching me a lot, challenging my mind, and is very fun and entertaining. It takes entertainment and education and mingles them together to make my down time at home productive and enjoyable.",5
The app doesn't make me redo my errors enough and is failing to help me grasp some fundamentals that I need to advance. It's not a shortcoming of the app it just needs to have a better platform for stupid people like me.,4
The best study - helping app for Mathematics and Science. It has very useful content and every parent should download it for the good development of their child.,5
"This has helped me a lot in terms of thinking like a programmer. Very informative and lessons are cruisingly manageable I have some request, hopefully you can offer a dark mode as well.",5
Very useful for concepts you already know pretty well but no options to review and practice so next to impossible to learn new math.,3
"Would be great if the pages would tender properly. Most of the time something is missing.. image, animation, formula etc.. makes it unusable",3
"Quite friendly, and the interface is quite robust, really thinking about start paying the premium subscription.",5
Trying to relearn maths as I need it for work. Brilliant is making it so much easier than I've ever found it before. Duolingo for maths.,5
"It seems like a great app but way too expensive, I believe that if you'd reduce the price you'll get more money because you'll have more people using it and you can effect more people which i thought that this is what you actually care about..",3
"Brilliant offers excellent maths courses for scientists and engineers. I'm a very ""cheap"" person and even I've found its worth the money. It definitely helps you think like a scientist.",5
"I keep finding no lessons in here. There are no explanations. There are only puzzles and hidden answers. It does not explain how to figure out answers. Tests work like that, not lessons. Waste of money it was.",1
"Suddenly, for unknown reasons, daily puzzles are no longer available in the app. Why? Also the menu makes it extremely difficult to find anything....",1
"OK so the service is lack luster and the payment is non refundable. I'm only rating 5 stars in order to gain attention. Spelling mistakes, glitching and basic information. Please avoid this app if you can.",5
"After looking for an app to actually teach me well in programming, this is absolutely the best one. Very well explained, highly recommend it.",5
"Really fun app. Impressive design. Great activities, and impressive curriculum. Plenty of free things to do while I decide to subscribe.",5
Haven't had any significant issues with the app! Brilliant has a variety of options to choose from. 4/5 stars because there's always room for improvement,4
Great app! The lessons are divided in small chunks that can be studied on the go. No need to focus for a long time to learn something useful.,5
Awesome! I want to finish every course in this app and get my year membership money's worth. Be warned this app is very addicting. You might neglect your mindless games and cat videos.,5
"It is the best app ever. People should consider the fact that Brilliant doesn't show ads and stop complaining that the fees is quite high. To the Brilliant staff, keep up the good work.",5
"This is great! I've just finished a problem about neural networks, and I don't even study programming! But, then again, I am a huge science nerd, so make of my opinion what you will.",5
"I dont know will you ever read this. Brilliant is the best place for any nerd. I like it, but I think the physics part should be a little more direct, And everything a little more arranged and tidy, but its all right. At least we have a great place!",4
It's alright but I learn better with people and in an environment for the tasks at hand. Digital learning is useful but kinda sucks.,4
"I absolutely love this app! I am learning so much. Although, you guys should add Macro and Micro Economics to the menu, spice things up a little.",5
I am in love! I have access to a wealth of knowledge I couldn't have otherwise accessed! I plan on purchasing a subscription soon. It's a bummer there's nothing on social science and literature in the app though.,5
The app is great but they suck you in by a long free trial and then they charge you an absolutely exorbitant amount to keep the app. Bait n switch,1
"Gahy it cost over 100 and annually only. No monthly subscription option. How stupid, hold down the poor people but the rich people are able to benefit. I'll just use Kahn Academy. It's better anyway.",3
A great app with a great interface and helps me learn key subjects. But I wouldn't pay for it.,3
I love the innovative ways it helps me to understand mathematical concepts! I am a visual learner and these examples and puzzles help a lot. 👌,5
This is a great little app to keep the brain fresh and a much more productive downtime distraction than mobile games.,5
"Very cool and fun app for learning. I only use the free stuff and it's very educational. If I wasn't broke, I'd consider paying the monthly premium. Awesome app!",5
"I was able to pass my math test, andi can learn computer science. It's awesome. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting this app especially for those who struggle with math.",5
"Even it is quite expensive comparing to other digital services one pay for, it is still a fantastic way to learn and develop your brain.",5
"This app is outstanding, but I have given four because, it has no dark mode in it. If you please include a dark mode option in this app it would be the best learning app!!! Please update it with that option...",4
Any type of concepts are explaining in a very simple way. I love it very much.Simply it's brilliant.,5
"Love this app. Makes learning fun and lessons easier to understand. Also, they've game theory offers incentive to keep going back every day.",4
It's a good concept. Please continue investing abundant resources to keep the software bug free. Dont add radical changes to user experience either. Thank you,5
"Amazing. After 15 years I finished school I finally understood what math was about, how to use it in an everyday life, curiousities. Every exercise has its own clear explanation so you will never get frustrated, even if you are wrong.",5
"Had technical issues, staff resolved. As learning platform very good, logicaly laid out building on each skill set. Will resubscribe in fall.",4
"The things is , if I open exercises sometimes I'll get options to solve them , but sometimes options will be missing , screen would be blank",2
"It's great that this app pushes you out of your comfort zone. The explanations are great, so it reels you back in and gives you the confidence.",5
There are too many errors with basic mathematics. They have the product of zero and a number as possibly producing a non-zero solution. I.E. x(y+2) =4y where x = 0 is valid.,2
Most of the puzzles I tried to complete wouldn't show up and the explanations for a lot of things were blank. Overall the app is very broken,1
DO NOT SIGN UP FOR FREE TRIAL - it is a scam. They charge your account 24 HOURS before the trial is up because they know people will wait until the last day to cancel. If you don't want to be scammed out of £100+ WALK AWAY,1
"Asks for money before proving itself to be a any challenge. Also, it wants far too much money and wants it every month. 25$ might be acceptable as a single payment. Wanting it every month is simply ridiculous.",2
I love this app. It helps me to have an active brain training whenever I have an available period of time a long my day. I don't waste time in social media anymore.,5
"Very useful and unique way of teaching, but I'd like to see what courses are recommended to learn before entering a new course.",5
"Intuitive and interactive, this app can give you a solid foundation of fundamentals, and build you up from there to great skill!",5
"I have started with neural networks. It did not takes too long to know that this application is highly structured, user friendly and vitally knowledgeable.",5
"Terrible support. I emailed several times with no answer. Trust me when I say that the creators of this app have no interest in supporting their app. Once you pay, you will never hear from them again. I couldn't even raise anyone during the free trial. Horrible.",1
I'm 16 and I had back surgery and was out of school for 3 years I'm finally getting back to school and brilliant has helped me catch up and be more confident trusting myself with math and stuff also there science courses are so cool 🤷‍♀️,5
"Great app to train your brain, refresh your knowledge and learn new things. Well-structured, user-friendly. Plus, lots of fun! 😊",5
"Duolingo but for math, but worse. Brilliant has a ""brilliant"" monetization strategy–it wants payment for what other apps offer for free!",2
"It's not cheap, but the courses are really great and the gamified learning experience is truly fantastic.",5
"Amazing how advanced and complex subjects can be presented at, not only entry level, but in a fun way too.",5
Please tell me how if one pizza + one donut= $11 and one pizza - one donut=$10.50 then how does one donut=25¢. Makes no sense... This is a joke of a app yet alone to be used for learning. Complete idiots! This part is in response to brilliants comment on my review. No it doesn't clear up anything because if so then why wouldnt the the second part of problem be one pizza - one donut=$10.75 instead of $10.50... Yet again makes no sense. 2022 Edit: You're better off getting a book.,1
"The app is extraordinary! I just love solving problems in this app.Truly speaking, It's method of Teaching is very beautiful & the explanations are also very helpful to understand the maths fruitfully.😍",5
"Amazing app, the price is a bit steep but the content and UI really does make up for it. I would recommend it, it's quite brilliant.",5
There is so much information to obtain or learn. Wish I were given the monthly option for 7 day free trial. Though 161+ USD isn't too much $$$ per year,5
Hi Please assist. I canceled this subscription last year after emailing someone at the company. I have just been charged again Please can I be refunded. I have never used this app and I have now been charged for 2 years,1
"Can somebody tell me why is premium so expensive? Why do you charge so much? Its not netflix, you dont have to pay any licenses, imagine that there are countries in the world where people dont make 3000$ a month, but 400$ or less.",2
Keyboard often covers parts of the exercise. Very annoying when you can't see what you're doing.,4
This is a lot of fun. And the real world examples are super relevant and helpful. I'm really enjoying the courses that I've been taking.,5
"it's...well, Brilliant. unfortunately I'm not and found that a couple classes escalated a little faster than I could grasp. but I'll keep trying.",5
"Truly amazing, a great tool to keep the system lubricated and functional. Appropriate level of challenges to keep you wanting more.",5
It's very clear while explaining the concepts and have great guidance. Enjoying it so far.,5
"Be careful the app does not let you cancel , somehow the subscription tap does not work , so you can access the menu. They will charge you and the you should report the problem .",1
Support simply won't respond when you have an issue and you really need help. Edit: 4 Stars as they actually responded after I wrote this review. Thank you Brilliant for responding.,4
"I find it fascinating that I don't really know what I know and this app teaches me more about the ""why"" in mathematics and sciences. Overall, the application is very informative and in other words, brilliant.",5
"Brilliant as the name implies, but I removed 2 stars because the content that is available for free is extremely limited, and the subscription fee is quite high I feel",3
"Good app to brush up on Algebra concepts for future maths like Calculus. There are science and technology topics too that keep me super invested in it. If you like learning, you will like this.",5
"For some reason it stopped displaying explinations for the answers. Also one of the problems had me try to make 12 with only 1,2,3,4,5, and 6. But I could only use 2 numbers. Which is not possible.",2
"Great app . Only that the pricing is too deep . I don't think this will reach as a favourable opportunity for its target audience... My phone costs 6,000 INR but this app's monthly subscription costs 1200 INR. It's just not worth the price",4
One of the best educational app ever made so far. One can easily understood the complex structure of the objects around us.,5
"It is the best app, you can try this app to boost your knowledge, memory, focus and you can study the school concepts too. But this app is little expensive for many users.",4
This app is truly brilliant no joke. It's amazing how much it helps developing yourself intellectually. i just hope it had dark mode so it could go easy on the eyes.,5
"One of the best platforms. But quite pricey for people with lower income. Even so, it has a big library of free courses.",5
"brilliantly collects too much information about me that i am not willing to give to an app that i can't even run without signing up, giving personal REQUIRED information. i can't even try it without doing so. bye bye",1
This is a UI disaster. Navigation is so unintuitive and claustrophobic. Also the new illustrations are ugly af.,1
This app exercise and strengthen the mind. Very detailed and in a relatable story like discussion. Also good visual easy to recall.,5
Would be improved by an assessment quiz for each topic to determine the starting point of each student. Without this we have the same limitation as a one size fits all high school classroom.,4
Really fun if you like maths and logic puzzles. A really good way to improve mentally and learn new subjects!,5
"I really like this app. I rarely rate apps, but this one is worth every star. It's a great, and easy, way to learn science. They make it understandable too!!",5
"Needs way too much infos before you even can check out what it actually does (which might even be good...). Give me a free (as in 'no account required') preview of what you offer, maybe I even would have liked it... Uninstalling now...",1
"Inherently flawed app as I can not pinch the screen, scroll or tilt to see the drawings or animations so I can only 'guess' the answer. B and C are not even on my 5.5inch screen.",2
"This is an excellent app, I'm thinking of getting the premium version! Love the graphics, daily puzzles, and learning style :)",5
"This is a really great app and I could see myself using this in the future, but I am not yet committed to a year subscription.. could you please make a monthly subscription plan?",3
Amazing app. Learned a lot. The challenge I needed. However I think the price point discourages many from learning more.,5
"Good but very unoptimized and slow loading times. Dissapointed, considering you guys are really smart.",3
The experience is quite interactive and the questions are good. There are also good explanations in case you don't get the answers right.,5
"This app has been great at explaining basic concept, connecting knowledge dots, and challenging our convenientonal thinking. For this much benefit, the subscription fee I considered to be worth it",5
Very interesting. Let's me approach and learn about subjects I would have otherwise have been intimidated or overwhelmed by myself. Feels like I have a mentor working with me. Really Cool!,5
"I struggled with math and science in high school. This app makes it fun and explains WHY things are done a certain way, something my teachers could never explain",5
Amazing app I am really weak at physics even though I don't Study it but still this app is amazing I really hope this app make me sharp enough to solve some basic physics problem without the main concepts,5
I subscribed and am very happy with this program. My mind is blown. Stop far have only worked on logic and have new tools for solving problems I have never considered.,5
Best apps of all time. Little to no adds ( can't remember if any). Teaching is top-notch. Etc.,5
This app just makes me feel stupid. I wish this app was teaching me on how to solve problems BEFORE throwing me throwing me in a dog pit and waisting bunch of time trying to figure it out. And many explations of the solution assume you already know a lot.,1
"Very simple and easy to understand problems that can refresh your memory, or help improve your knowledge.",5
"I recently bought Brilliant Premium Subscription but was disheartened to see that the courses contain a lot spelling mistakes , it's really frustrating , I humbly ask the developers to fix this",3
"The app is well crafted, exercises are understandable and intuitive. I think it's a great tool for learning.",5
Intuitive courses and eye-catching visuals. Having a lot of fun learning with Brilliant!,5
Don't install if you want to learn for free.Only the first chapter of each game is free. I would give a 5 star if all the materials are made free to learn by watching ads instead of paid membership.,1
"I would like thank the whole team of Brilliant who worked on this educational app. I have a question, is there any way to enable dark mode in your app? Or there's already a feature to enable the dark theme? By the way, loved this app. 👏👏👍",5
"Some of these questions are reaply hard, but after deleting (rage quit) and reinstalling, I've already started to do better just based on some of the skills i acquired the first time i got the app.",5
"I wouldn't suggest this app, I got it for my 9yr old. It should start on a scale so you can learn. Seems like it's built for those who already have a foundation on complex problems",1
content aggregation with a bow. most of these questions are available on the internet. they do a good job of usability and presentation. so the high cost for this is not justified,2
"Many answers require input of negative numbers. But the popup keyboard then lacks the minus sign, making it impossible to enter the correct answer.",1
"I was doing the puzzles and this thing forced to come here to leave a comment. Yes, it is a great app, now can we go back to keep doing the puzzles.",5
"Make it completely free no need to waste money on a premium to get the whole thing. Just do the add removal with payment, not the content that can actually help me better understand.",2
Wonderful app for those who love math and would also like to brush up on their fundamentals. Beautiful design and functionality.,5
It's a nice app. And I heard it presents courses in a simple way for easy understanding. Its definitely something you can try out,5
Unable to use the app as I keep getting prompted for a subscription even though we have had a subscription for at least 4 months.,1
Recommended for life long learners. Can download content and access offline. Very intriguing quizzes and challenges,5
The app and the lessons are great but they seriously need to consider the premium plans. It is way too expensive!,4
Everyone talks so good about it but its really just a scam. They just trick you into their subscription and then you pay way to much money for nothing.,1
Seem like a good app to learn in but in order for you to actually learn anything you have to pay about 30 dollars a month and a price that high should be said before you download the app.,1
Incredible app! The community it has amassed is superb. I think it would have been better if some courses were fully free.,4
"What A Waste Of £82, Wiped My progress and took my premium away, still have an active subscription on play store but Google won't refund and the brilliant support team aren't quite as brilliant as they make out.",1
The best app for students who would like to learn more about their preferred subject. Lots of courses to choose from for any individual.,5
*edited 207GB of cr.app.ees ranking the top 3 worldwide! Its shifts between nr 3 and nr 2 rarely reaches number 1 butt hay you can use to wipe it your ykw! One extra star makes it even complicater where the crappees goes io! tytf 😭,2
"The app has excellent problems and even as someone with a math bachelor's, I find the content engaging and interesting even in the simplest courses. I do think that this is a hypocritical service however, given that they claim in their mission statement that they do not discriminate against people. However, putting up a paywall as large as this one definitely does NOT indicate any sort of commitment to anti-discrimination. Discriminating against the poor is still discriminating.",1
Brilliant is simply brilliant !! It offers a unique intellectual experience. Designed elegantly and provides the opportunity to learn and gain new skills .,5
"I would like to be able to opt out of leagues/streaks entirely, but I loved the logic courses. Overall great app design",4
Brilliant is just plain awesome. It helps develop skills like proggramming very easily.i recommend it to everyone.,5
Great app offering numerous interactive courses for those who want to use different approach to solve many problems.,5
Let's you Rekindle with your love for Mathematics and Science.. The Challenges are designed to challenge understanding of subject rather that now a day do it fast attitude.. It also teaches us the art and joy of problem solving.,5
I enjoy it. The cost is worth it. I stopped spending hours scrolling on social media and spending money on caca. That makes the $100+ worth it for brilliant,5
It is really an amazing and BRILLIANT way to learn math and logic. Minimal interface which is an exellent idea.,5
Amazing mini lessons and excellent quizzes. I love all the topics and they are easily digested!,5
"There are plenty of bugs in answers. I provide the correct answer, the autobot advises it's incorrect so I click on explanation only to be presented with the answer I provided in the first place.",2
"very good app. but being a student, I can't afford 4800 a year it's too much, bring down the subscription fee to 150₹ /month. i can't pay that much.",3
I'm doing Brilliant as a math and science refresher course. I like the way they use each step to build on the last.,5
"Excellent Application for Students, Educators and Regular people alike. Easily to use and interactive lessons keep you engaged and interested.",5
"Paid app disguised as a free app.. After all the sign up process it is asking for membership fee to continue. No, not giving my card details for a 7 day trial.. Uninstall!",2
"So far so good. The exercises are engaging and the explanations are quite clear. Brilliant app, alright!",5
"Very engaging problems, the new daily function is a good way to monitor your progress for free.",5
"LOVE IT!! I have the premium membership, and I've not regretted getting it, the way the information is presented is just the cutest think ever, you are inspiring a young generation of thinkers ❤❤ keep it up💛!",5
"App was excellent but now i can't login my account. Why this happening right now? Plz fixed it, may b problem in app. I tried several time uninstall and install but still doesn't work it😟",5
"This is turning out to be fun, challenging and entertaining. I am exercising my brain, which is proven to slow dementia, feeding my ""little grey cells.""",5
A fantastic app. It works well on my device (sm-j250m) without any crashes or glitches in the courses (none have been observed so far).,5
This app has been such a blast so far! I am learning an absolute ton of knowledge that I wouldnt otherwise because they present it in such a fun way! Like the logic course!,5
This app is helpful to get back to the foundation of learning with a tactile experience. I feel engaged while entertained.,5
"Just started with Brilliant and love it so far. Lots of options, love how the courses are presented.",5
(1) Very intuitive and insightful regardless of culture; (2) Leaderboard based on Exp w/ Exp earned by completing lessons; (3) Free version still has plenty of content,5
"You can't find any other better place for a best learning eperience,I enjoyed a lot,and also learned a lot while using this app.I hope they (makers of brilliant) will make the app more awesome in future and I thank them for this wonderful app",5
"Nice user interface and teachings. But there is only one small problem,some of the explanations are a little bit hard but the app is still good anyway. Brilliant app🤓🤓",5
"As the name says, It's brilliant. Their courses are second only to a university course and have helped me loads on theory for my coding projects- notably the computational biology on my evolution simulator",5
"Great app. I really like it. But subscription is really expensive, especially in context of prices and salaries in my country.",5
Very nice app. I couldn't think of a reason not to give it 5 stars. Gentle reminders are helpful rather than annoying like other apps can be sometimes.,5
Amazing and intuitive learning experience the animations and interactive shapes and illustrative explainations are a great way to learn.,5
This is the first time that i admire an application this much. It is just amazing and really useful for self improvement in various sciences. Just love it.,5
Best educational app I've ever encountered. Would recommend it to anybody wanting an understanding of what the world we live on and the amazing things in and past our solar system.,5
"I dont understand the forced year subscription of 90 euros , i despice subscriptions on apps but this is ridiculous and it also did not accept my Google account had to use fb only to get a year subscription shoved in my face immediately ...",2
It is an awesome way of learning. I do read it in free time and always get a new way of interpretation.,5
Brilliant app (pun intended). Has really helped me enjoy solving problems and helped stretch my mind. Tha k you also to Smarter Every Day (YouTube) for pointing me in Brilliant's direction.,5
"Excellent App. You will fall in love with it. If you enjoy learning new things, then this could be the best app. But the subscription fee is toooo high",5
"Regret even signing up for the free 7 day trial because they have deducted the entire 1 year subscription fee from my account and now when I'm trying to cancel my trial, the support is not responding to my queries.",1
This is one of the best app. fully featured. I Would like to request for a feature on this app that is to ask problems like we do on web. That would be much more comfortable.,5
The creators really must have put a lot of effort into this app. the lessons are well researched and written. The app is well thought-out and easy to use. The questions are on topic and provocative.,5
it was by far the best app I've downloaded and one of the best decision I've ever chose. I find myself wasting time on my phone constantly and with Brilliant I'm now using that time productively. Such a genius app and website,5
"Problem approving card. It might not be your fault, but I can't approve my card payment, and then on returning to your app, the payment isn't recognised.",3
"My app won't open, at all. Just a white screen for a second then it shuts itself off. It's all good now, thank you. I uninstalled then re-installed.",5
"The app is great, but you need to take out a ridiculously expensive subscription to access the content. Think I'll stick with Khan Academy...",3
"Super experience! Giving you a completely different and practical way of looking at a subject, you gain new perspectives on the problems you're trying to solve",5
The app charged me before the 7th day ended (trial version). I sent an email and got cheese answer telling I have to fill in a request form an they will come back to me in 5 days. It was about 20 days and 4 unresponded follow up email ago.,1
This app is fantastic! The courses and puzzles are both a lot of fun and equally challenging.,5
"I find myself feeling stupid very quickly. It's amazing how difficult simple concepts are to grasp, and Brilliant helps me grasp them quickly",5
"So worth the money! For the same price that you can get a subscription to a popular television bundle, you can pay to get a scientific education without having to deal with pompous professors!",5
"Fantastic. I use it a lot. It's continually improved, the support is excellent. I've the full version and it is definitely worth it.",5
The greatest learning app ever. You can learn so easily and its fun. Great app. Hats off to the developers and writers. Thank you guys. You are awesome.,5
This app provides a great starting point for those interested in Computer Science. The fundamentals are explained in great detail and with explanations that are easy to understand!,5
This application does a fantastic job of conveying and teaching the concepts it makes available. Some way to access my records of questions and results to confirm my work would be appreciated however.,5
The idea behind the app is great however the app itself freezes mercilessly every two seconds.I have to delete and reinstall every time.Exhausting.,3
I love this app I play this app in stead of playing games my brain thrives on information like this I don't know why I'm dyslexic and my mom says I that I'm Electronically minded so maybe that's why thank you guys for this amazing app. challenging my self to do good😉😁😊,5
"I wish it was a little cheaper.. other than that, I love the app, no morebgaming for me. Thanks to Brillan I now have a super productive thing to do while killing time, improve my skills!!",4
It's an excellent way to study math. I have been improving my math skills by using this wonderful app. I want to study an engineering major and it is helping me to do it. I have no words to describe how grateful I am. Continue working guys!,5
Adverstises like education is free. Downloads the app and it bugs to go premium..Who wastes money on apps?I want free education without subscription..Can't evem complete a course This app deserves 5*.I would give it 5* of the courses were free,2
I have to say it is the best learning app but it is too costly for some people to afford. If you make it full free then I bet you this will become the most popular and top rated learning app.,5
Good intuitive app allowing to learn complicated concepts in snippits and frequent quizzes. still need to explore more,5
it's great for learning and sharpening skills. this app has been helpful with my performance at work and I feel more mentally active than before. thank you so much devs,5
It's simply brilliant! Makes learning fun and I actually feel like I'm absorbing the information. Great course on quantum mechanics.,5
Content is presented succinctly and easy to memorize. The UI is nice and easy to read.,5
"Was not able to test it, since immediately after installing they are billing you for free trial. If it is free then why the hell you are asking my credit card details?",1
It gives a new puzzle every day that racks your brain. I would recommend it to everyone. There is a monthly subscription attached to it.,5
Perfect app for everyone who want to learn something in the technical fields of maths and science. Useful for everyone from Beginners to Advanced.,5
"The wiki is good..but the app's system is hilarious.it charged twice to pay,,and even after paying twice now the courses are showing locked...",2
This App is truly remarkable. The questions compel you to imagine a wide range of scenarios and carefully go over the presented info. Really gets your creative side working.,5
"Very good content, illustrations easily to grasp the concept/idea. A handful apps for science hobbyist.",5
"This is the best learning app I have ever had, a place for active learning. And getting engaged to the course with a new perspective.",5
Very invasive. The privacy policy really makes for some reading. They can take your whole browsing history and social media profile and share it with whoever they like for money. Will they be putting that equation on their app?,1
"Over priced and no way to cancel in the app. Uninstalled after logging in while on free trial. If I see a deduction in my bank, there's going to be hell to pay.",1
"Love it! I got it because I was tired of playing mindless games all day , but this is a wonderful way to kill any extra time you may have in the day. Very educational, and fun, too!!",5
"This is one buggy app. Ironic, given I couldn't complete a quiz on computer logic and programming, due to bad programming. I'll be staying away.",2
"One of the Great app for problem solving and mathematics,. But premium membership is too much for students some of students can not afford monthly 400 rs. That's why i am giving 4 start instead of 5",4
this is no different then reading a text book and answering a question every few pages. nothing is explained and may question are based on knowledge NOT presented in the text. Save your mony and just get a nook.,2
"The app's lessons and quizzes are bit difficult, but I learned new methods and passed the board exam as 5th. Thank you brilliant!",5
"Learning on the go. Wherever you are, you can still get what it's explaining to you, whether it's computer science or algebra or discrete mathematics!",5
"Very well done, I love this app, I am learning and also truly engaging thru the teachings. It's an app im telling all my friends, family and co workers.",5
Except payment woes everthing else is fantastic. You may ask then why I have rated 5. Because I will try to subscribe again once my money comes back in my card. You are simply Brilliant!,5
The best app in the play store . it's the most exciting app and very useful for the enthusiasts students as me as well . it is made for IITans and all the brilliant enthusiasts. the no. 1 app.,5
"It's a really great app! Be it the explanations, the interface or the short quizzes. The app is nice!",5
Doesn't work. Useless support and a total waste money. Super expensive one year subscription in terms of what you actually get. It's a total waste of money,1
Challenging but it is still a ton of fun. I have ADHD and this seems to keep my mind busy so that i don't get myself into trouble during boring meetings.,5
This is an awesome app for learning however they charge you a lot for the premium membership but the rate at which the platform is improving makes it worth paying,5
"The concept is great,but I can't experience the app very well because the loading is really long even though my WiFi is great",2
Brilliant shines in its methodology to incorporate a synergy with each topic lesson that builds a problem-solving mindset. Very cool app!,5
"Why is the price of annual subscription so much lower? Why is the shortest term 3 months? They just want to get as much money as possible while you are still in ""honeymoon period"" because it might and often will end and they know it.",2
I can feel the neural pathways reaching and growing further exploding into ideas and creativity every day more and more...its brilliant!,5
"The learning and resources are amazing, my favourite place on the internet, the app just needs a little performance gain.",4
"After getting past the introduction to any topic, this app has the nerve to try to charge you $30 a month to be able to do anything else. While I would be more than willing to pay money for this, I would not be willing to spend half of my phone bill's worth.",2
"The brain version of a super comfortable gym. It's the first up that I open when I wake up, and the last one that I use before going to sleep. KEEP YOUR BRAIN IN SHAPE!!!!",5
It's an interesting and challenging mental exercise. It focuses on understanding concepts rather than memorization.,5
this is the perfect app except it's too expensive for a student so if it had a option for $10 a month I'd buy it.,4
Extremely satisfying way to learn and apply concepts. Absolutely worth your time.,5
Great app. Makes you think and develop your abilities to solve problems... And of course you are learning new stuff along the way )),5
"Love it, but last time I bought a years subscription got ill and couldn't use it enough. Wish there was a 70yo+ rate to help us retired fixed incomers to enjoy it always.",5
Looks like a cool app but the free section is very limited and the premium is very expensive. Don't bother unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars per year,3
"This app is great will really recommend this app for those who have the habit of learning and for those who would like to learn. This app is easy to understand only if you have the willingness and positivity that you can have that knowledge. "" This app is brilliant"".",5
Great app for learning new skills which can be useful in real life and professionally or reintroduce you to concepts you thought you were bad at (especially maths),5
"It's just amazing, or dare I say: Brilliant, I've never been able to pick up a topic and learn it so fast before and that is really something special.",5
The only and biggest killer to this app is the price point. Perhaps Brilliant got to be more brilliant in setting the right price in the education industry.,1
"Great learning platform for a plethora of different fields, just a shame that the premium engulfs most of the app.",5
"Well worth the price. Then again, not big on wasting money on iphone or newest android. I prioritize learning so was well worth the money. Paid for the year subscription.",5
"After some time, I'm raising the overall grade from 4 stars, to 5 stars. It's funny and useful also to introduce some new concepts.",5
"It's a fun way to work your brain. I just do the free puzzles, because the premium version is pretty expensive.",4
"The app is absolutely great in content, however it need to be a lot more developed as its lagging at times with some errors in the question and answers.",4
"Great content, but the app sucks. Often not responding / laggy even with s10+. Sometimes the question doesn't load either even after restarting the app.",2
It is a great way spend some time exploring a range of problems and concepts Highly recommended!,5
"I signed up for the free trail and it was going good until it ended, there was an accident and brilliant fixed it right up in no time, thanks brilliant",5
"It is an incredible tool to enhance learning through reasoning, fun challenges, and interactive lectures.",5
Would be perfect except sometimes it doesn't let me scroll for some reason. I try restarting the app and my phone but it doesn't work.,4
"I would like it to have videos explaining the stuff and you are expected to quickly learn the subject, otherwise, it makes you feel dumb.",1
"This app is really amazing with full of interesting courses. I am a student and I don't earn any money, so I haven't bought full version yet. But in future, when I earn money, this is going to be the first thing I am going to buy.",5
"Visa card (international) not accepting. SBI Global card for international transactions. ""Your card does not support this type of purchase"" but it actually does and i have used the card for international transactions.",5
Paywall on everything and no way to get anything through wathching ads or unlocking through achievements. The money they use in advertising themselves should be used develop and maintain the app,1
Quite intriguing . IT is more addictive than netflix or video games . I would like you to update new chapters in most of the courses. Special relativity. Electiricity and more,4
"There should be a Reading mode in the app where the screen doesn't timeout, considering the content is all readouts.",3
Fantastic learning experience. Great for all those who seek to learning and being challenged.,5
there's a bug where the scroll won't start unless you sfroll really hard. makes the whole content hard to use. other then that the materials are great,2
Got dinged for the full year subscription before I ever even tried the app. Clearly they 'got me' good considering its way more than I would ever pay for a phone app. Yeesh. Guess I'll try it now that I bought the damn thing...,1
"Way to expensive, they wanted $149 after the 7 day free trial. If you want to change you pricing then I would have teir'd pay levels which grant daily time tokens to use for lessons per day and make the 149 an unlimited teir",2
quite nice but way too expensive or missing smaller subscription options. understandable if 30+ employees need to get paid though. ;),2
"Great, but needs more free content - it would make a lot more sense to have more free trials so that people will actually want to buy premium. Apart from that, this is a good app.",3
Beware!!!! Don't ever subscribe for any course here if you opt for payment they won't even ask for confirmation once or otp authentication all they need is money. I accedentialy spent ₹3840 on the subscription,1
A fantastic learning tool but just too expensive. A $10/mo plan would make it accessible.,3
It's fun and mind opening. Even from the beginning you feel that you are building for something big like Quantum Mechanics.,5
"This is it. The most EDUCATIONAL APP I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!! on a more honest note, this is SO MUCH better than even khan academy(no offense), And if you think I am paid, you're wrong.",5
This is best app to learn concept of math and physics but it's subscription is too costly.... it is creating a barrier for me...what'f cost reduces.,4
"Great concepts, fun learning lessons, but way too expensive! Only for deep wallets. Discrimination at its core.",2
Fun way to exercise your mind when you have a few minutes. Also a nice teaching opportunity when doing puzzles with your kids.,5
"This app is very good, it clears lots of concepts. But I am unable to bookmark the daily question. Hope it can be done soon.",4
"It's a gym for your brain. It's fun, engaging, challenging and educational on so many different topics.",5
Well you know...I find it complicated.I think it is a great app but I can't get the idea.I mean....I don't know how to explain it.For example let's take the case in artificial neural network.I literally don't understand a single concept in here but you are trying to convey something but I don't understand what the thing is.I don't understand how to do problems here.However I never gone through other stuffs.Please make things more easy and understandable.I think that is what I wanted to convey😕☺,2
I think there will be much more better results in schools if somebody will teach trough these methods ! BRILLIANT app !! Keep up the good job 👍!!,5
"What a great way to learn on the fly. Instead of scrolling through media feeds, I am learning new things all the time. It's helping with my social media addiction, big time.",5
"Brilliant have so many interesting topics, it's not just perfect for keeping your brain active but also for learning new concepts",5
being a mathematics lover I love spending time with this app to reminisce all the concept i have learnt and It developes the analytic and critical thinking in me... so I would recommend evryone to utilize the time in d best possible way..,5
It's great for learning in short bursts! It's fun too! It's like an expanded Big Brain Academy.,5
"It is a waste of time, and I it glitch every single time I used it and when you do the correct answer it says it is wrong :( 😞 😓 😩 😤",1
"Content is great, but the premium price is too much for my broke college self. If you can support the cost, I reccomend it!",4
App crashes at start since last 3 updates on Android version 5.0.2. So I am unable to use it. Please fix this issue.,4
"Brilliant makes me feel like I'm inventing math by myself! But it would be really awesome, if it added more content for practice.",5
A lot of education available in quiz format. A great community interested in math and science problems. Nerd heaven. Great refresher for any topic.,5
"Learning is not that hard, but motivation can be. Brilliant makes it fun and engaging to learn.",5
"Expensive, but helpful. Would be better if you have more lessons about physics.",5
Very best app to learn many courses for free and for stretching out brain activities absolutely love it thank you Brilliant team for your efforts😇🙏,5
"Buggy. I answered quiz correctly but still the program said I was incorrect. When I press the explanation, it shows the correct answer which I did.",1
Please fix the godawful side scrolling nonsense. Half the time solutions are just unreadable because rather than scrolling to the side it rolls over to the next question. Frustratingly terrible ux.,2
"This app is dope. I love it because is like having a book with lim knowledge -> inf, but without having the kilometric-ton of papers. It's worth the subscription.",5
This app is just fun . I really recommend it guys it's been so much helpful to me on my math and i think it will be as enjoyable and educational to you all to.,5
"The lessons dont always open, but it is a very useful app to learn more about everything! Appreciate if you guys fixed the opening problem though",3
"I love this learning app, used it for a long time and I learned a lot of things, which it is free! I didn't need premium, and I had a wonderful experience.",5
It's an amazing app for learning coding because it makes you understand the code and syntax instead of just remembering it.,5
"It's beautiful to learn from basics to advance. Being a professor in Mathematics, I love to revise my math through Brilliant time to time. It's authentic & advance",5
"This app is limited to kids. Even EDUCATION is prohibited by this single app. Kids that had curiosity won't able to solve problems in this app. I hate it. Why people want kids to ONLY learn things and not other things? This sucks, change it.",1
The best way to learn Real science and math very enjoyable way. It looks almost practical Wow! What an amazing app.,5
Can't get enough of the learnings. Killing the guilt of not knowing certain concepts since childhood bcz my school and college decided to skip some chapters :) Thank you!,5
"This app has such great content, and the questions at the end adds as a bonus. And I find it easy to use with new content being added regularly",5
"It's a nice app. And do its job great. Also I have a suggestions, you should use a guide book, which a user have to do while doing course.",5
"Inquiry based learning in action. You'll get excited, and figure the laws and principles yourself. Great for curious people who want to learn through practice on a bite sized problems.",5
"Amazing app, took free 7 days trial, coz I'm sorry but 92 euro it's a bit too much:) P. S. Nevermind, just found out it offered me premium subscription for 92. So app is amazing:)",5
"It's great, I would love if they incorporated audio into it though as I usually prefer listening rather than reading",5
"I really enjoy the basic puzzles, the intermediate ones are mostly beyond me, and the difficult ones, fuggetaboutit!",5
I love the app. I used to use it back in 2016 when I was in high school. The app has gotten even better now. I hope they keep expanding their courses to more advanced topics.,5
"The exercises are awesome, and the app is well done in general. Great way to spent time learning new things.",5
"Nice and fun way to learn.Hope that in future more advanced courses will be available, especially in mathematics.",4
"I really enjoy this app, although sometimes you lose your progress and have to repeat quizzes and the python compiler is soooo slow...",3
brilliant is such a great app it has so many different subjects to study and such a fun way to keep your brain active and sharp,4
Best app to learn logic and enhance thinking with brilliant mathematics and logic questions.I am a student and will be happy if the year subscription amount to be discounted.,5
It's useful for many math and science related problems. I guess if you use it daily you'll get the hand of these problems and the thought process,4
"Exceptionally Brilliant learning tool. Amazing and worth every penny. If you need it for Science and Mathematics, high schoolers it's for us folks.",5
Had my subscription auto-renewed for $120 without warning email or anything. for the first year of my subscription I didn't find I used it much anyways and I didn't realise it would auto-renew :(,1
"Incredible! There are so much daily content explained in a different way that I've seen in school, this app is really explainable.",5
The math lessons are easy to follow. They take complicated ideas and simply them into easy to digest bits.,5
"Shady membership cancellation, not designed for someone looking for fundamentals even if it does provide courses targeting that zone (does not do what it says it does). I dislike the overall experience.",3
I love it. Way better that my teacher because she won't explain as in detail as Brilliant and you can do quizzes on the spot I reccomend this app if you want to learn,5
I had subscribed for annual subscription and even paid money but they didn't gave me the premium after payment and even didn't responded to my email for days. They don't even care. Please don't run such scams.,5
This app is amazing and full of knowledge. I can learn so much from all corners of this app. Along with Khan Academy this is one of my top favorites for self study.,5
I like the app it's very good and am giving a sasation that you shell add some kind of music as there is just silence and after some time it becomes boring to do and I think it will be more interactive great app✨,4
"The app and courses are great, they are helping me regain my math skills and improve from there, very well done. I would give it a 5 start review, but in the story problems, whenever there is mention of a company, the name they give the company is Evilcorp. Really? There are so many indifferent names that could have been used and the choice to use that as the selected name? Business is not evil, capitalism is not evil. Your company is not evil, be better than that.",4
I like the app alot but i deducted one star for the expensive rate for the amount of content. Also i hope to include a bookmark option to the quizzes and wikis to be a reference.,4
I liked the app it's totally amazing but when I wanted to subscribe to the primium app says this payment options is unavailable.I tried with many options but no one worked please help me with that.If did this will be a 5 star review.Thanks,3
"The animations don't show at all in my android tablet, it's impossible to continue with the course.",2
Please add a dark mode feature. The UI is not so comforting for the eye at night.,4
I'm unsure how to quantify the benefit this app has had on my life. I have been able to target holes in my mathematical knowledge that I did not know existed before as well as expanding scientific breadth.,5
I opted for free trial yet they have charged me an annual fee. The page to un subscribe is down. I get no replies to the emails I write. Do not fall for this SCAM!!!,1
"This is a very good app to learn from, but it's expensive for young adults. So it's not as easily accessible as other platforms.",5
"We need an option to disable all those distracting animation movements, please. Not conducive to concentration.",3
Wonderful app. A must-download for people looking for great brain exercises. Perfect for all levels.,5
"Very interesting and entertaining. Really having fun and the courses are truly encouraging, almost addictive.",5
"Be Careful/Aware !!!! with the surpise of 'No Refund Policy' for either subscription, monthly or annually, if one is not satisfied for the service/content. (Usually any educational app has refund policies, but this one does not have the same) BRILLIANT !!!",1
"This is honestly the best learning app that exists. Would be better with a trial of premium, but I would 100% recommend to anyone.",5
"Kind of okay. But it requires a bit of more detailed explanation in some lessons. Also, courses are limited. Only 60+",3
"Great app, easy to follow. Always interesting topics, from easy ones to those most chanllenging and tricky",5
"I hate the way this app approaches learning! After spending a lot of time and money, I learned very little. No refunds are given.",1
Hi so I'm a 6th grader and I have gotten so much better at science and engineering since first using this! And it's also extremely fun! I would 100% recommend this app,5
This application is amazing. I would like to know if I am allowed to make videos of me trying to take the courses on youtube or if I am allowed to stream doing it.,5
Recapping is fun and all. I was having some ups and downs with critical thinking but I can still get the math remembered.,5
"Learning at your own pace through applying knowledge, not just reading it. Highly recommended.",5
"Very well written lessons, followed by quizes that test your comprehension. Possibly the best learning tool I have found.",5
"It is exactly what I needed. Now, I understand deeply some mathematic concepts once I was supposed to learn just by some formula.",5
"Blinking Brilliant. A great way to learn new things, delivered in a concise way.",5
stop offline content is disappointing. you can't reset a full course. Otherwise the content is good and different than others,3
Amazing techniques to stretch our minds out of the box and helps us understand topics .... Loved the creation!!!!😘👌👏,5
The app is great. It shows extremely hard concepts in a very plausible language ... Really is great.... Best app for learning new things .,5
I like this kind of approach to learning. Through exercises and explanations. Much easier to understand and remember.,5
"Great and innovative way to learn scientific concepts. But, so expensive! No student can pay this amount of money!",3
"Inspiring me to keep learning science for over two years now. Never paid for an app ever, except this. It will always be a part of my life.",5
"Perfect it just needs a few more courses and more in depth explanations, im my opinion premium isnt worth it maybe its diffrent on the website? but i reccommend it all!",4
They have multiple flaws in their quizzes with wrong answers. My confidence that quizzes are correct is at a all time low.,1
Currently brushing up on calculus for my own sake. So far it's been a good study aid for me. Hopefully the lessons will help with upcoming engineering exas.,5
brilliant is very useful for my studies on science i am very happy with all the courses but i am disappointed that a premium version must be bought to access more lessons,5
"Learning made simple, effective and easy. Totally in love with this app. Highly recommended for learning enthusiasts.",5
Really amazing app! Though premium is too costly for Indian market. With almost no marketing it is unrealistic to expect this much from Indians. Rest is mind blowing.,4
"Great app, breaks things down, make concepts easy and straight forward.",5
I can understand so much and have so much fun but when I was in the middle of a lesson they can acsess more if I don't buy premium. (I was so disappointed😞),4
"I love this app! I've always enjoyed math, and this is an easy way to keep learning after univeristy.",5
It's a great form of learning on he go and very addictive. Too bad most of it is behind an expensive subscription paywall.,4
Unable to manage and cancel my subscription. Does not show and I've been charged. Not happy at all.,1
"For something that is supposed to be brilliant, they can't get the password reset process correct. Oh and how much? Way too much for a casual app.",1
"Awesome app, very interesting even if you are not educated enough to understand every problem here, this app will teach you how to solve it. Brilliant",5
"seems pretty dope so far, though i think a corresponding yyoutube or audio recording would be even more dope, like what if you're doing something and can't scroll.",5
"It's let's me learn at my pace!! anyone with families, or work, or even college that wants to invest more into new or current studies but have a busy schedule.. this is for you!!",5
Almost excellent. Often happens that I hit continue in a quiz and nothing happens. I have to sweep to the right but this way it doensn't considers my answer.,4
"Too expensive monthly price for basically some puzzles, i know there is more to it than that but still...otherwise good app to take a look into",2
Brilliant teaches subjects in a interesting and engaging way. It is also sufficiently challenging.,5
"5/5 best app to learn. cheap and amazing, it really help you understand what it putting down, 30 min a day is all you need, become smarter everyday.",5
"fun n simple, maybe diff to choose a category of subject. and imposing figures of hodtility.",2
"Bought a subscription to use offline at work and NOT ONCE have I been successful without using data, app is about 80-90% done, very disappointed with my purchase.",1
"A lot of interesting learning. (Only tried e-mail and free basics, not ""learn more purchase"").",5
"If you're the curious type especially for STEM subjects explained in a simple way, this app is simply brilliant!!",5
"Very addictice, but in a good way. No other educational app has been so fun and so good for my brain at the same time.",5
Awesome tidbits of random information you wouldnt otherwise learn. Recommend doing one small course a day just for that little extra knowledge,5
"It's a paid subscription service, there is no free version. They don't really disclose that until you've downloaded the app",1
"This app was very useful, I learned a couple of things already on my first few hours on this app and I still have alot to learn. This will put me a little ahead of my school grade material.",5
"Very mentally stimulating, nicely put together. Makes you think and challenges you.. Increases your awareness and learnings.",5
"This initiative this truly astounding. Providing world class academic and general contents in a systematic and affordable way is something that needs to acclaimed. Please provide more detailed advanced Math, Finance and CS contents soon.",5
The most comprehensive and easy to use learning platform available. A must for anyone who wishes to widen his knowledge.,5
"Course pages dpn't load fully, sometimes less sometimes more after app restart. Very buggy.",2
The best app to learn difficult concepts in a very intuitive and fun way and increase your knowledge!!,5
Charges $150 after a 7-day trial. That's the worst business model I've ever seen. I might have tried it if there were a monthly sub option. I'm a student and don't have that kind of cash to throw around.,1
Awesome app even in free state. Just check in daily for a new challenge. Not sure about the premium benefits though because I didn't buy the premium.,4
"While I enjoy doing these problems on a web page, the app os surprisingly accessible and easy to use.",5
It helps you to really challenge the brain and clarifies questions better than standard middle school/highschool education.,5
They are different from other educators. Excellent community and awesome puzzles daily(as I am using free version 🙂),5
It is the best educational app.It explains concepts very intuitively and really engraves those concepts deep in the mind.Also such high quality educational material is not presented in any other app.,5
Awesome ! Wanted to have fun learning some math and physics basics and it helps a lot !,5
"My friend suggested this and I've been seeing this on YouTube, sponsoring my favorite content creators there. So, I started it and it's really awesome!",5
A very good app for all who are interested in learning... especially the physics courses..I really enjoyed them,4
I like this app so far it is really helping me to increase my knowledge plus I like a little challenge and this is really challenging I will give another review in the future.,5
The app is really good. It helps to clear basics and boost up knowledge in maths and science.,5
Brilliant! As its name! Developer Could you please do one more brilliance? Give each user one option to unlock the whole chapter for free of his choice. This will be very kind action and helping one.,5
The best way to learn anything is from brilliant their courses are extremly easy and everything is explained in very detail,5
"The Trial version puzzles are all good, but i wanted more. Don't like that most stuff is behind Paywalls!!",3
I don't have enough words to describe the level of this app . It is just mind blowing. Thanks brilliant for bringing in such a creative way of learning at such a cheap cost.,5
Too many bugs. Constantly getting stuck and can't continue. Disappointed because it seems like such a great app.,1
Really good it helpful for people who want to study the free course is really good and I learner whole computer science for free,5
im not the smartes person and i was looking for a tutor couldnt get one anyway this app is proberbly better its got everythink i need to know and more im so happy i gave it a go you could pay a tutor $20 to $50 per hour our you could just subcribe to the app its pretty cheap in the long run,5
"An app that makes maths and science fun, if you haven't gotten one on your phone then you are missing alot.",5
"Very well made app, perfect for anyone looking for a great online learning experience.",5
"This app is probably the most educational app on the Play Store. It takes concepts and breaks them down into interactive and fun fragments that you can play with and learn in an organic way, like when you were a kid.",5
Awesome !!! BUT should be free for a limited number of subjects. Too expensive for many many people who need it !!! Capitalism at its worst ... AGAIN. PS - Needs better graphics and AGI for Real PERDONALIZATION!!,4
A really easy-to-use app at a suitable and good level. I subscribed because I really really enjoy working with the app. I really like the logic course!,5
"Won't subscribe unless it's a monthly subscription. But now I don't trust you won't charge my card. People just get a new bank card so your not charged with out your permission, since they have zero regard for customers we'll earned income.",1
You are guaranteed to learn the stuff that they teach but the progression is slow and sometimes boring because of too much wording and easiness,3
"The app is now bloated - leagues, streak charges and unnecessary animations. The app also does not organize the topics and courses well.",3
"Lessons are excellent, visual, bite sized and rewarding. A great balance and learning that sticks.",5
"Good courses, could be more in-depth. Way too expensive, Khan Academy offers similar courses for free.",4
I like the approach - we'll laid out / put together not sure if 'subscription' $168(after 7-days) is charged against googleplay regardless? I'd have preferred a month-to-month option - to be able to try it for a month and see...,4
"""Back"" button resets the progress, instead of closing math keyboard. Improve the UX ((( in any case, reset progress with no question is terrible",1
Very nice and expensive app. I'm pretty sure there's a good percentage of users who will complain about the pricing. This isn't so different from elevate app but this is way too expensive.,4
The app is nearly flawless and the content is-- dare i say-- Brilliant. Totally worth it. Excellent gift for the nerd in your life.,5
This is a truly fantastic application. However the price point for premium would seem to be beyond the reach of people that would get most benefit from this application.,4
"You rarely come across an app which is as useful as Brilliant, if you are a math enthusiast. I absolutely love this app, it's lifetime subscription is so worth it. ♥️",5
"So easy to learn math and graphs the concepts it's better then anything else out there, but some courses are fastes paced",5
Math made fun through quizzes. Additionally the UI is eye-catching and smoothly created. Thanks for this brilliant application!,5
Very concise and effective. Excellent for anyone who is always busy but want's to learn new things..,5
"Math taught as it should be. This carefully explains each part to me and does one thing that I find no other app do, make math MAKE SENSE. THE best math app I've ever come across.",5
Great way to understand the basics of different types of math. The lessons aren't too long so you can chip away at a course throughout the day and it doesn't feel like you're constantly in the middle of it,5
Love learning new theories and concepts everyday from the smarty brothers. Quite into geometry and math at the moment and getting my mind blown. You too can have your mind blown with Brilliant!,5
"If you're looking to actually learn things, it's worth it. If you're looking for a free app that makes you think for a second or two here and there throughout your day, maybe not. But personally I love it and recommend it to everyone I know.",5
"It's perfect, but I really want you put a choices to select the language, it's all. 'Cause your perfect.",5
"Amazingly triggered and intact, learning is strategic and interesting. Could use a note floater to carry through the lessons.",4
"This is a great app. All the puzzles and riddles are fascinating. But its too expensive. I know this is a quality app, i expected it to be highly priced.",4
While the courses are great i dont like the annual payment.Its off limits for me for that reason. Its a shame that such good courses are in a platform created by such greedy developers :(,1
Stopped being able to open any of the lessons anymore. Just loads then goes back to the lessons menu repeatedly.,1
best way to start something. I can't guarantee that it has the toughest question but i can bet that it has the most creative ones. Best way to learn is to design your own questions.,5
"Yes brilliant, is brilliant even in actions and contains amazing logics, statistic, probability, and for data scientist is more important.",5
The content is basic and the pricing is too steep. Stick to reading if you want to learn anything.,1
"Transform yourself from low-level chump to a knowledgeable wizard of the craft. There's something for everyone here. Coding, math, data science, etc. I love it. You will too.",5
Awesome app and UI. Lessons are paced well with enough repetition to learn the material and not get bored or exhausted!,5
"Brilliant is a wonderful app to keep your brain sharp. It is fun, easy-to-use, and I love that brings back memories from my past learnings",5
"Units in feet, Miles etc instead of SI related Units. Awful for a Wannabe scientific App. Positive ist that there are some nice Tasks. Would give IT four to five stars If the imperial Units are gone.",3
"also trains you to read the entire question, including the prelude. some questions are worded poorly/are unnecessarily complex though.",4
"Such a good application, even if you leave the application mid course when you open it opens just from that. Awesome just a Great App.The free version is just so good I love it. Good job developers👍👍",5
"It's an excellent learning tool. Problem of the day is a good idea, a mental exercise for the learners of all ages.",5
I bought premium I feel the practice should include more picture as some topic e.g. algorithm It 's hard to keep up with imagination power from only words,4
Fantastic app. Keeps crashing though. Also- I have premium but I can't download without it prompting me to buy premium,3
"Easily the best app I have on my phone, there's so much to learn and it really walks you through everything so you don't end up feeling silly for having forgotten all your high school math",5
"great puzzles but only samples are free, actual content is either $30/mo. or $10-12/mo in one chunk of $115 up front.",2
Awesome experience. Concepts were explained clearly and precisely. I recommend this app to anyone studying mathematics,5
It's fun to learn with brilliant I lost my habit of doing maths and had forgotten the basics thanks to this app I have revised the fundamentals of mathematics. So grateful 🙏,5
Hats off to the Brilliant team brining difficult concepts in easy understanding way with interactive charts and diagrams etc.,5
"Learning is so much fun, the rewards keep you going. If you get stuck, go sleep and try again tomorrow amazing how far you can go !",5
"An excellent educational app. The only problem is that it is not completely free😂. And I don't like that loading animation, it sucks!",5
I think you should added more language it can make all country that don't understand or can't English easier to read and understand in their language.Besides it make more people to understand math and it can make this app popular.Hope you reading this feedback from me.,5
Love it! I'm 62 and need to keep my mind busy. This is perfect! Tons of topics and the app is stable and reliable,5
The only way to use this app is to sign up for a 7 day free trial using your card details and then pay £83 a year so if you don't want to do that this app ain't for you. No idea how good it is as I'm not willing to do that.,1
The app asks a million and one questions before getting anywhere near learning anything. I can get the same info myself without being hussled for data I don't want to share.,1
Great app! I would really appreciate it if it loaded faster and I could see and manipulate my saved quizzes.,4
"Great app, it teaches general subjecta like algebra and more narrow ones like neural networks!! In a applicable way. Reccomended 100%",5
Very interactive and lots of effort was put into every course I've taken. Highly worry the price,5
A very nice app for growing science courses. It has no ads interepting. You can install the app don't think so much 😁😂,5
"Just fun to learn bew stuff, inruitive, helops with grasping concrete concepts instead of abstract ideas via interactive games/visualisations.",5
With brilliant you can learn the laws of physics and therefore understand the nature in a fun and simple way.,5
Haven't even paid for a subscription and yet they're giving me knowledge for free.....been on the app for about a month now and it's great my brain is as sharp as ever👍🏿,4
"Real great step by step approach to science. The interactive visuals, used to illustrate complex topics, are excellent",5
very good concept and explanation.. one of the best platform for problem solver and quick learner.,5
"It's a better app to spend scrolling through, than meaningless reels, chats and other distractions galore.",5
Excellent application which emphasises on self learning would be even better if you add a tool to doodle rough work in the problem page.,5
"I attempted to access the second arithmetic course, but unfortunately, the loading process never ended. Despite my efforts to patiently wait, the course content did not load promptly.",3
"Excellent app you can practice the topics on free time and everywhere, i like it and I recommed it to everyone.",5
"I really should not have to pay for quizzes or tests. Kind of defeats the purpose of expanding knowledge and learning, especially if it is based on financial growth.",1
Rock solid. Keeps things intuitive and gets you to juggle possibilities before settling on a logical final answer,5
Content is great but the app is quite buggy. Buttons often don't work and progress is frequently lost,4
Great app for improving the skill of problem solving ability. And also a tremendous one for enrich the logical sense.,4
I am using the test version of the Brilliant app and find it is really flexing my brain muscles! Saving up for the premium account!! Thank you Brilliant.,5
The app is really Brilliant. But $162 a year it is really too too much guys. $30 would be acceptable. $50 at most. $100+ is crazy.,5
Very powerful learning tools. Interactive and insightful. Best way to describe this app in 1 word........ Brilliant!,5
The application sometimes freezes and I cannot interact with it. If that resolves I will happily give 5 star superb app!,4
"Lives up to its name. I'm enjoying it a lot. Time will tell if I use it enough to justify the cost, but from what I've seen so far it seems very fairly priced for the effort that has clearly gone into making this product.",5
"Did the free trial, and was impressed. Definitely worth the money. Focused on mathematics (foundational math, number theory) to refresh my skills.",5
I love the app but please please please bring Problems of the Week back. the daily problems are far easier and not so cool.,4
I love it! I learned about physics mostly through Wikipedia but brilliant really helps make the knowledge long-term.,5
Brilliant is a fantastic educational resource and this app works adequately. I like the offline courses feature.,5
"Its an awasome app for all science lover, the sections are designed in such a way that anybody can fall in love with the subject.... I suggest it to everyone.",5
Super interactive lessons from basic to more complex levels. Could offer courses access at much lower prices to expand knowledge to lower income people around the world.,4
"The learning process is just amazing , I only started recently but I can't stay a day without learning.This is indeed the greatest app of all time.",5
"The app is pretty cool. I'm far along in my career, and I'm still learning new things from this app. Guess the saying, ""You are never too old to learn something new,"" is still very much true in this day and age.",5
Best learning experience and great methods. Very elegant product and excuisit design. Love it!,5
A wonderful tool to learn key STEM concepts. I am very satisfied with the machine learning course.,5
Truly excellent but it could incorporate math curiosities like the channel numberphile. Or at least links to popular math channels in youtube.,5
"The only problem is that we have to pay monthly for the full content. The app is extraordinary, but the monthly pay is too high.",4
Absolutely love the way it creates small puzzles for me while reintroducing me to concepts I've completely forgotten since high school.,5
"really brilliant, subscription fee was not affordable for me, UI also could be more organized.",5
This is really amazing app that makes you smarter and intellegent This app has many courses that represents the knowledge in such a way that makes you to be curious about it and inspires to learn it.,5
"I'm enjoying getting to learn math again at 29! I loved it in school, but chose a career that doesn't require I do math.",5
Search engine not showing desired results. Only work when we switch to quizzes tab and then wikis tab and then refresh.,3
"I love this app, it helps me feel productive, and helps me upkeep my learning regularly. I feel as if I am REALLY learning a lot with this app, and I highly recommend it!",5
"Brilliant is brilliant. Just have issues with the dependency on internet, would love to have puzzles saved for offline use",4
"Nice, clean interface with plenty ofwell-thought-out examples, explanations of each.",5
"Perfect to learn new things and maintain your brain active, they have quizzes that challenge your intelligence",5
Love the courses. Hate that I can't download them now. Currently I can't get anything to load on my phone. Paid a premium for this app but now can't access!!,2
Great math learning tool with lots of visualisation to help better understand concepts. Fun also!,5
Hello I have been using this app for 7 months and its very useful for students.But i have downloaded this app on my phone and the text arent showing Please fix this bug Thanks!,1
"Excellent ap. Really professional finish, so many topics, so useful to the enquiring mind.",5
"Brilliant is a good idea to use your time by brain work.It would have better than it is if,full course would have been free.",3
If it was a bit more clear about explaining the course it would be awesome But in general it's great to start learning day to day.,4
"Knew a decent amount about coding and math, and this has improved my computer science knowledge base prepping me to take on machine learning. Truly useful stuff!",5
"Had problems but good support feedback and now fixed. Content to my liking so far, I like the quiz approach and good explanations.",4
"Worth the money. I will give 5 stars after some bugs are fixed, e.g. quizzes randomly becoming unfinished again.",4
"Excelent app. It's a shame I cannot afford the premium version, the free content is not enough to keep the app installed.",5
This is a great app. I have an interest math and the material is educational in an easy to consume format.,5
"I can't afford to pay that much, atleast add an ad based option or one lesson per day free like that. Please don't completely block the lessons behind paywalls. We can't afford 😭😭",3
"Very simple, small chunks that add up over time and make it easy to pause and digest the material.",5
The content of this application is really good but you need to subscribe if you want to access it and the prices are ridiculously expensive. Sadly I'm going to uninstall this app.,1
Why don't you'll offer monthly subscriptions to your Indian users? Don't feel like paying for the entirety of the year in advance. This gives me a buffer to unsubscribe if I'm not enjoying the app. Let me know if such an offer is available,4
Great app for understanding concepts visual explanations are amazing. Accidentally I found brilliant. But it is really brilliant 👌🏼👌🏼,5
"Kind of expensive for the premium, wish I had the extra money because it was well worth it for the plethora of different courses offered.",5
"Great app! Very rare bugs and glitches, but wonderful learning platform to keep me from losing my knowledge",5
"Truly an amazing app! If you love learning, but have an aversion toward rote techniques then I highly suggest you invest in subscribing.",5
Very engaging puzzles that help you learn/understand how maths works. Really enjoying doing these!,5
"Brilliant app. Very smooth user experience, the lessons and topics are very well done. Love it",5
"Looks good but tbh guys is far too expensive, higher volume lower price is needed, shame. Rated on price primarily.",3
The app is very useful. it's way teaching keeps you engaged and focused on the topic.,5
"I've only been using the free version so far but I've actually been really engaged and enjoying it, will go premium once I've exhausted the taster lessons",5
"Was pretty much just what I was looking for. Well made app. The free version has a decent amount of good questions, and is very thorough when you need it to be. Glad to have it.",5
"All the bad reviews are actually fake, the developers hav resolved those issues and the guys hav forgotten to change their reviews. This app can actually make ur logic skills go next level which u cannot even think of, amazing app.",5
Excellent way to solidfy and revise concepts which may have been rushed over in class.,5
"Awesome app. Think like a Instagram hell, but this one helps in opposite way. Teaches you foundations of knowledge of universe and humans work of technology.",5
"Brilliant has been a gateway into a new facet of personal confidence, where once math anxiety existed has now been replaced by supported curiosity!",5
"Great app, even at a uni level there is alot to learn. K would highly recommend using it as young as possible.",5
"They make complicated topics easy to understand. Many intuitive interactive demos to get the learnings across. אחלה, החלה, ממליץ בחום",5
Its the best app to learn your interests very nicely and easily and problem solving method is the best way to get clarity about a topic.so its the best!!,5
"Python currently not working on the app, making it unable to do the courses I want to do. I've tried re-installing and still doesn't work.",1
Great variety of subjects to learn. Also the explanations are pretty easy to follow,5
Giving three stars because it looks interesting and full of content. Not giving more because I can't start without paying a monthly fee,3
Very fantastics to use I like it to use. But as it got to be limited with money So a kind of unaffortable for people like me. Thank you for free part of this game.,5
"Don't sign up for their intro plan. The cancellation button is ""mysteriously"" broken until the free period ends and they charge your card.",1
Another app with a 7 day free trial. Why can't this be made obvious so that I don't waste my time installing it and signing up before I'm told it's not a free (ad supported) app?,1
Understanding solutions lesson 10 out of 58 on math is not loading at all. Ive installed and uninstalled and powered my phone on and off. It needs debugging.,3
"I am enjoying solving problems, only downside of it is free version provide a very limited questions and premium is too expensive.",4
I wish I could give half star as the rating. These developers of brilliant are so 💰 hungry that this potentially one of the best apps to study is totally ruined. Developers if you can see this critic then please lower the charges or make it literally free and I will propagate this app to everyone I could find.,1
"The Study of Complex Numbers is an excellent course. Practice questions can be challenging and require some ""deep"" contemplation.",5
VERY helpful in the pursuit of knowledge regarding physics and maths. Such an accessible app for learning!,5
honestly Brilliant is the app we neeed nowadays it helps us in thinking critically and we get to actually LEARN how and where all the scientific laws are applied. they even provide a sensible explanation too for an incorrect answer and the questions are from your daily life which makes everything so much better.,5
a really enjoyable and helpful platform. I wonder why is it still not much known to common public. But I am really learning a lot from them.,5
"It is really good. You might think of it like a Duolingo of math, science, data science and computer science.",5
"Even though premium is reaaaallly expensive, I recommend even the basic set as it brings some considerable joy and satisfaction when a fun and demanding task is solved.",5
Did not use upon realizing there was no night mode (and instead an all-white screen at that). Did not assess content.,3
"I'm obsessed. I never pay for apps, but I've paid for this because it's been helping me so much. I started it for fun, now I'm using it to refresh myself so I can help my kids with their homework.",5
"Charinging me over 100€ for an ""annual"" subscription as default, after a free trial? You're joking right.... Never gonna use brilliant ever again. You've lost me.",1
requires money for everything. it’s a good app but they could have done with add viewing instead of money.,4
Honestly as an old fart who's trying to remember what i learned in school this app is pretty cool. Looks like theres enough to keep me busy for a long time,5
Tons of fun problems mixed with thoughtful instruction. Seems to be a distillation of the best problems and instruction out there.,5
This app is 'brilliant' when coming to learn more about science and mathematics. Hopefully it will continue to nurture the minds of many other people who would like to learn about how the world worked around them.,5
Great app but using the system keyboard seems to caus some issues. I'd like to be able to disable it and just use the in app keyboard or disable the app keyboard and just use the system keyboard,3
Very helpful learning aid. Has explained concepts successfully and quickly to me that I haven't been able to work out using Khan Academy,5
"Yes, of course ""Brilliant""is brilliant among all prevailing identical apps, I am amazingly overwhelmed by using its applicability.",5
"It's very addictive. However, I wonder if there's a way to show your progress to your employer? Or there could be some credentials from this app that employers might be interested in? Thanks.",5
"Great idea for an App, but why do I need to sign up? Why can't I just start playing? I uninstalled the App right after it asked me to sign up. Why are you in such a rush to take my personal details and bind me to you? Let me fall in love, first... Sorry, but I ain't gonna even try it untill it's more accessible.",1
"Great app, huge variety of lessons. Perfect for educational improvement or just as refresher!",5
Great app for Master any subject of STEM. I would highly recommend it to everyone who want to learn and think and want to make a change in the world.,5
"Great great resource for brushing up on old skills, or learning new ones on the fly.",5
"Terrorists, I did the free trial cut it two days short opted out uninstalled the app every month they try to charge me $100 anyway. What do I got to do to get youNazi freaks to stop trying to charge my account. It's like a bad episode of The twilight zone or a not funny a cable guy movie. They won't stop they just won't stop . STOP",1
"Brilliant is brilliant indeed, anyone who's interested in developing their analytical skills should spend daily at) least a few minutes on this app.",5
Nice app. I love this app. There are various types of problems here. This is a very useful learning app. Thank you very much for this app. Try to build many apps like this. Best of 👍👍👍👍👍,5
This content is no joke I like to think of myself as smart and it's challenging. It's the thinking equivalent of a pull up bar. You can't half heartedly mess with it. A rare find TBH,5
New progress indicator does not work. Even after solving five question no progress is registered although my days streak moved up by one.,3
"Absolutely amazing app,keeping your attention its very interesting and on very special snd interesting way it brings you into computer science....Love it!",5
Best ever learning app ever seen... But subscription rate in Indian rupees is too high. Should have separate package for India,5
I really enjoy this app. So many great courses at a very reasonable annual price. There is a seven day free trial so that you can decide if it is for you.,5
"Very good and a lot like the style of Duolingo, they constantly update their app and improve it.",4
"My experience on this app is amazing. I love to explore science, math, new concept about interesting thing and this app helps me to do so.",5
It's actually making math something to look forward to and explain it with fun storys and interactive lessons.,5
"wow what an app ... amazing , its so good to use. But if the prices are low then we can buy premium ... please reduce the premium prices...they are soooo high for broke students like me ........",5
first thing i noticed is that there is no landscape mode for the tablet. Lazy. Even Khan has landscape mode.,3
Like the visual learning aspect to understanding concepts. Really good. Enjoying it,5
Arguably the best learning app out there. One problem though is that whenever I complete a lesson the app just stops working. I hope this gets fixed soon.,3
"The app is great but be real careful I accidentally select the 12 month subscription they said, I tried to get my money back the second I noticed no one could help me they said",1
Fun math learning. Encouraging feedback + variety of subjects. Do ponder on what subject you want to better.,5
Very wonderful and useful app,5
"Great app! I I really like the logic puzzles, I've surprised myself with my progress. Hope they add more leagues soon.",5
"How hard can it be to find a competent developer to make a non buggy app. Honestly wish could give this a 0 star rating. I'm kind of regretting this 1 year, i takes Good knows how many mB to check an answer.",1
"Courses are great. App is good, but missing dark mode, which is important for many people.",4
Brilliant is a good tool to keep learning. It's good for understanding concepts from scratch,5
It's great. But we really need a dark theme. It's disturbing to read at night. I'll give the stars once we get the dark theme.,2
"I Liked your app Earlier but now you removed the Problems of the Week Feature, It was great but you should not remove it. Instead You should add a Feature called Practice Problems Search to search problems in the Practice List.",3
"I'm still angry with the change of logo. What is this thing? What a bad move. Great app and great service otherwise, but I just hate seeing this icon.",4
Excellent app for learning concepts It helps you make your weak concepts crystal clear and level of problems are from basic to level 5 jee advanced.very useful app,5
"The app is buggy, and crashes. If you like teachers who just give you tests without explaining the subject, you will love Brilliant.",1
I see potential for self teaching only problem is that the layout is quite basic.,4
"I find it well made and they provide free lessons to consult if you're not ready to pay the hefty price. You don't have to commit yourself to learn, you can just wait the weekly newsletter that will provide interesting lessons.",4
Amazing App help me keep my sharpness on point and with problems to do occasionally who wouldn't download this app its really great to review the world we live in and its quite interesting love this app.,5
Good hands on lessons leading through the concepts needed to understand critical thinking and probability,5
"Love the app no problem except the pain of not wanting to pay premium. But it's fully understandable why, but I'd love to just do deep dives into subjects without needing Saif premium. 10/10 tho",5
Definitely lives up to its name. This app is brilliant. Explains concepts in a very understandable number. May your light bulb remain bright fellow user.,5
Subscription price is ridiculous. I would rather have the 150$ a year spread out over a monthly cost instead.,2
"This app is extremely expensive, not willing to risk running into a bill of 17gbp/m after the trial. The app looks great though, sorry.",1
"I'm learning many things. It increases power of thinking, combines all the possible ways to solve a problem. Good app",4
Makes learning fun and helps me understand the logic and opens up my mind to more solutions and strategies to derive at the best solution possible.,5
Really good a making you think in different ways and stops you being mentally lazy as often the answer is no straightforward. Would recommend.,5
Requires a credit card or PayPal just to access it making it hard to even get on. Man im just trying to learn math. 179$ a year is insane,1
looks good. useless without the 110$ CAD subscription. only 1 intro lesson for all the actual lessons with free version.,2
Excellent app! Exactly what I was looking for to stay sharp and brush up on math instead of playing a game to kill some time.,5
"I like it and I can see it being challenging for kids, but it doesn't have an option to share in your family library. I'm not going to pay for this for each of my kids. Let me know when there's an option to pay more for a family plan.",3
"I like courses, how they are organized and collaborations which you have with different educational communities, like kurtzgesagt. But I wish it was available on several languages and had a teachers interface too. Where I can create classes for my students and see their progress. If that possible, I'm ready to collaborate with you and helpt to translate courses on Georgian language. I can mannage to create little team too. Because my students are excited when I translate this content for them.",5
Super helpful and has a complete course of subjects!! So excited to learn more here!,5
"As an adult that wants to learn as much as humanely possible, without the worries of collage issues, I'm happy to see this app/program exist.",5
"great app for self teaching, better then textbooks, as it is interactive and easy to understand.",4
This app is the single best I've ever seen it has lots of information on different fields and has a lot of pictures.The apps just great,5
"Love the app, but you can't reset progress from mobile. Customer support keep saying well let you know when it's fixed....",2
It's really good for understanding basic programming for me,5
"worst UI i have ever experienced, everytime i want to make call, i face a lot of struggle to find my contacts.",1
i like the idea of this app. however knowledge at this level must not become a product and means of profit. i need to study these courses and i can't afford nor have access to international purchase methods. this is a perfect example of capitalism and how it affects people.,1
Brilliant consistently challenges your understanding and perception of the world and I am having fun processing and learning though every problem thrown at me.,5
Excellent app and webpage. The system for teaching is very entertaining and all ways keeps you interested in the topic,5
"It's owesome app, I like to use it. They give you curses and challenges. It's such an enjoyment to solve them. I was stupid before I discovered this app. But yes, I got smarter by using it. Very recommended ya.",5
"I installed the app but after few min, it closes automatically. So i uninstall and reinstall but the problem still prevail. So unfortunately uninstall permanently.",3
Very good for a student. Good type of questions as Multiple Choice Questions. Very good app for increasing skills in maths especially.,5
I really enjoy learning with Brilliant and it helps me with getting my maths straight and learning new science topics!,5
"Easy to use, well worth the money for premium. I haven't found any bugs. I have found a love for STEM subjects.",5
I love brilliant!! A lot of my favourite science videos are sponsored by them!!! They are doing a wonderful job!!👏👏👏,5
It is one of very few things I still use since my childhood. And this is self explanatory that how useful and interactive this application is.,5
"The website is amazing, but the app crashes a lot on both Android and iOS... for me it is unstable...",1
Got a bug in the first lesson offered: the expression box is blank. Hello? With the price of the subscription you should look if someone in the company is embezzling money instead of paying the testers.,1
Nice idea. It's not free and all the pages are blank. On browser works for me but in app no.,3
"very professional, engaging, and educational. I notice that i am challenged in each lesson and am constantly expanding and proving my knowledge.",4
the purpose of the app is great the only downside is that all the actual learning courses are behind a paywall.,2
First time I've been able to learn complex topics in an online environment effectively. Great work.,5
"Every time i solve a problem or two, it's kind of rewiring my brain cells !! Phenomenal experience",5
"You said the startup problem has been repaired, yet the application crashes on startup. Get this fixed and stop making false statements.",1
It is a fun and interesting app with great educational content. I like the interface too.,5
"Concept is brilliant) but android app is very poor. Editing pyhton codes is painfull, even copy paste functions don't work properly. Onplus 6t android 10",3
I love Brilliant. There is so much choice. I am not saying I am good at everything. In fact I have put down one course because I found it too hard. But I can go back to it later.,5
Enjoyable learning experience!,5
Workout for the brain. I think I'm gonna teach my children maths using the stories in this app. They accurately explain very complex principles with real world applications.,5
INSPIRING. Can't say enough good things about this app. People need to know how exciting science is. Public school has failed us. Download this app. Especially good for early mornings.,5
This has been a great experience getting familiar with programming and programming concepts. I would definitely recommend.,5
This is a great app! I love working on the different courses to help keep my brain active & working.,5
"Brilliant is simply a brilliant app. Anyone can learn from it, it's fun, and you can learn in any speed!",5
This is an extremely good app.....prepares u well in the topics covered.....what could have been better are the explanations.....they should cmplete layman like so that every person can understand what is being explained,4
the questions when retaking a course don't change. There aren't enough exercises on individual topics.,2
I love to think about problems .I like this app because it gives me lot of problems which are enjoyable. You should also download it. If you are reading this then give this app a chance . It will impress you for sure,5
"Very slow app, terrible didactic. UI lacks many features, like searching and lesson contents.",1
"Make learning easy,",5
"i love this app, you don't have to suscribe or pay to enjoy it (although it is so good i'm actually considering suscribing) (which would be SUPER impressive for me!)",5
"I'm a student. I'm already paying enough for knowledge as it is, so why would I want to pay extra to refresh my skills? Just make the courses unlimited and free, I don't care if I have to watch a bunch of ads.",1
"I never thought I'd be able to understand anything so complicated,thanks",5
"Before I used to just look at memes when I was bored, but now that I have Brilliant, my mind is always active even in the slower parts of the day, and it gives me an excuse to use my phone.",5
What a beautiful app! I'd love to see some vector calc and analysis. Maybe some classical Mech too.,5
"When in this day and age an app asked you to register & create an account for absolutely no reasons whatsoever, uninstall it because it won't worth it. Uninstalled.",1
"Great app, although it lacks some more advanced topics, such as fluid mechanics and thermodynamics for engineering.",5
Awesome place to learn things but you should give some discount for students. I am not able to spend that mutch money as a student.,4
personally I love the app. it's a quick and easy way to learn unique information. but I think it needs to all be free,4
I really enjoyed this app. Just very unfortunate that you have to pay after introduction content. But it is still a really good app.,5
"They charged me $129.50 AFTER I canceled my trial subscription several days before it ended So if you wanna try it for the trial, watch your bank account, you may have to do a dispute.",1
Ok so this app is BRILLIANT but I'm only in year 8 and I don't even understand MOST of the things It's teaching me but I know that I am going to need it later on so when I need it i will just get it again but I very highly recommend it to you,5
Really enjoyed the app until it blocked me from going further and asked for way too much money in my opinion when there are plenty of other resources available. Too much $$$,3
Math/Computer Science... Couldn't find anything on economics or money. Not sure on the value of such a narrowly focussed app in achieving brilliance...,1
it's an amazing app!!! helps to clear concepts for math but I would suggest them to give options of videos for clearing concepts even faster and better,5
I would consider purchasing the premium feature if there were monthly supscription because the yearly supscription is too expensive. Thank you,4
Awful subscription management. Android app never offered free week trial like iOS. Bought a month only to have it not recognize my premium purchase. No support until weekday. Thirty dollar dud. Buyer beware!,1
Brilliant app explains concepts really well with good animations. Make it visually pleasing,5
"I love it. I can browse for problems and wikis about math, logic, and computer science easily.",5
awesome and very fun. also made me actually good at maths,5
Great app. Great fascinating problems and variety of courses are it's main features.,5
"I like the app itself, but I wish they would just make a monthly subscription option. I would actually get premium that way.",3
"Cool but too expensive, it's definitely a good idea only thing is it's not worth it to be 24 dollars a month. I would use it but sadly it's way too much money for what it does. Way over priced.",1
"The best app to learn STEM, it is interactive, clear and it is creating new great courses",5
It's really amazing and has helped me a lot but i'd honestly like to see some more chemistry courses than just the one available now.,4
Super easy and bite sized learning. Worth the bucks if you wanna consistently increase your knowledge,5
Awesome brain training.,5
"It keeps saying failed to open lesson, whenever I try to continue from where i left off last time. Really annoying",3
It makes learning key concepts of STEM in a fun way. Highly recommended.,5
"Prior to the app, it was difficult to grasp algebra but now I enjoy it. Definitely recommend to anyone willing to learn all content the app offers.",5
"It's good, but there are better alternatives for the price this costs yearly. While I enjoy it, it's not worth the price. Even with a discount.",3
Easy to learn,5
Be aware I canceled my subscription before the annual drop since I got it for a month for free but it still pulled out the annual amount,1
"Too bad, it seems like a decent app with laudable breadth, but the astronomical subscription price has to be largely subsidizing greed or inefficiency or both.",2
"Very good app, perhaps the best. Yet it would be better if you add an option to pay monthly 499 for anual subscription.",5
"might be cool, not enough preview for me to even risk $200 on a yearly sub 🙄 the lessons are very short and left me with no confidence I'd picked up anything, I was making mistakes in my last free questions",1
"Excellent app, 5/5. But what the heck you do to your app icon, looks ugly, looks like duolingo's eye.",3
Amazing app for learning. Love how they break down math into real world problems for you to solve.,5
Please can u make it free for a limited amount of attemption(like duolingo) or play ads U r good but i can't have full access to the material nor can i buy it,3
"Like it's educational way of teaching different topics in a simple, fun, and effective way.",5
No free content besides the 7 day free trial. Courses don't cover anything beyond an advanced high school course,1
Great way to semi-productively pass a minute or two! It feels very rewarding to get an answer right as well.,5
"The concept is there but there really is a lacking of explanations. If you dont understand a lesson, tough luck there is deeper explanations for anything.",2
"I thoght to give it a try, I subscribed to yearly permium and found out they do not refund !! I only wanted to see is it something I am interested or not. DONT GET INTO THEIR TRAP",1
Great Educational App..very Sharp Quality Task & Solving using Mathematics & Geometric & Formula Codes are Nice & Shiny As well as Fun & Enjoyable to Solve them...but it Glichs alot..please Fix the issue,3
Best learning app I've ever used,5
Used as a supplement for school; ends up lowering my self confidence rather than helping it. Probably fine on its own.,3
Best learning experience with the exceptional interactive learning method that become engramined in the memory easily,5
"I love it so much, brilliant is truly a great app for the sharpminded and a training course for students",5
My only issue here is the price and the fact the billing is on yearly basis for some us we would like to try for month and see weather we like the app or not,3
This isn't a free app. It doesn't magically make you smarter. If you're willing to put in some time and work on paper it gives you everything else you need.,5
"I would love more biology courses. It's a brilliant app, I would recommend to anyone!",5
"It's the perfect amount of challenge, playing this game.... and feel semi productive doing lol also appreciate the notifications of accountability! 5 stars- fo sho!",5
Awesome! I haven't even paid anything for it yet and it had me do a demo lesson that was intriguing and made me actually have to think.,5
"A fantastic and useful resource for learning. If you want to learn anything about anything, this is the app for the job.",5
"Excellent for better learning with clear concepts, problems and elegant solutions.",5
So much content and very good for an adult coming back to learning practices again.,5
"Educating? Yes but only if you're a premium user other than that there's really no point in having this, as it will block your progress with the paywall after finishing the first lesson of a course.",1
"Wow im impressed, this is what i have been looking for, it consists logic games math tutorials, it really helped to get better at crunching numbers",5
I waited far too long to give it a try.,5
Amazing way to learn,5
Interesting and funny,5
"Excellent! Absolutely worth taking a subscription also, as learning has never been this quick and interesting!",5
Enjoy this very much.,5
"I accidentally tapped start 7 day free trial... it said that verifying payment... I didn't want it so I quickly closed the app and uninstalled it... so have I accidentally played you? If so, what should I do?",5
"Sure, I should learn information from other sources, but this app gives me lots of practice and it say how I can solving something problem if I did mistake. And It motivates ΧD 5🌟 of course",5
The exercises are very effective for me in remembering concepts and strategies.,5
Brilliant is a wonderful key to help learn and everything else but I just wish I could have it on my Chromebook it doesn't like to play very well wish you guys could fix it,5
I will be able to do incredible things with what I am learning through this app. My subscription will be permanent. 10/10,5
"I just started learning Python, and I find this application very useful to combine with other study methods. I use it daily and really like it",5
I loved this app .I love brilliant and maths but I have not enough money to get its premium.Wish I could access all the wonder of math and physics for free,5
"Brilliant is a brilliant app for learning new skills, as the name suggests : ) . Helped me learn new skills to improve personally and professionally.",5
"Great step for becoming an engineer, an accountant or a computer programmer. It's also very interesting to study in it. But the problem is they are asking for money.",4
"Incredible tool to grasp complex subjects in just minutes (at any level of formal/non-formal education, doesn't matter one bit mind you.)",5
"This is the first app that has tempted me to cough up a monthly subscription, but you are fully out of your minds if you think I'm paying $25 a month. Bonkers.",4
"I start the first course ever. It's called ""Introduction to algebra"" . I have to write an answer 4R or R4 ....I can't even write the R because I can't see it on the keyboard and I can't even copy and paste and ""R"" letter.....",1
Couldn't even begin. It wanted me to enter my birthday in numeral and slash format but it refused to let me open a keyboard that had slashes on it... Brilliant! 񗐴,1
Amazing and nothing but the best,5
Great conceptualization to learn new things! App glitches at least once a lesson.,4
This app help to activate my brain again. I can improvise my way of thinking and now i feel like I'm a Brilliant. Thank you so much for making this app....,5
Havent been on much. Heard alot about it and hoping i can work with it for free. But either way i would wait because this seems like something good to put money into.,5
"Great app for understanding how the universe works by putting theory in practice with real life problems. It's fun, enjoyable and you learn by solving REAL problems",5
"This app is so useful and interesting, It helped me a lot. A 👍🏻for brilliant app.🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟. The best part of this app is it's courses,quiz and it's solution , daily challenges. 😀👩‍🎓",5
"brilliant is such a great application for learning science and maths, it's gives the Deep detailing About what we want, i have never experienced such a app before with deep detailing",5
"Enjoying learning calculus in my spare time. Didn't expect that! I'm not the kind who takes technical courses for fun, so that says something.",5
I like it overall but had to disable notification spam,3
Brilliant is as the name suggests... Need I say more.,5
Very useful to learn new topics. Entertaining quizzes. Highly recommended 👍🏼 😀,5
The 1 star is because the app loads slower than expected though the connection is good and the RAM space is fine.,1
"Just 101% incredible, it really helped me to ace my exams at school and have fun in learning. Highly recommended all the way",5
what happened to the courses that have been taken down? and also the community feature? when will those courses get published again? i did not pay a decent amount to not get enough,3
Make it cheaper. Ill buy if its 20dollars or less,5
very nice and useful app,5
I'm very happy to see such an app...,5
A very nice learning app,5
Great for kids with eager minds,5
you can't find better app!,5
Did not know it was something to pay for,1
Fun learning experience,5
A fun way to learn.,5
If only school taught like this...,5
"Can't get into the app. Keeps saying my account was deactivated, and/or inactive, yet my email is registered.",1
Excellent 👌🏻👍🏻 highly recommend.,5
Intuitive interface keeps me from doomscrolling the news. Highly recommend!,5
Very good app and amazing support too. Highly recommended for beginners and professionals alike. 😁,5
It's a lovely application,5
Fun and Instructive,5
Developers pls add a dark mode 😭😭 My eyes hurt,5
Best learning apps,5
Marvelous app for learning,5
"This is a fun app to exercise your mind and strengthen your cognitive processes! I'm glad I downloaded this app, a healthy way to kill some time.",5
Like the neural network part,5
Incredible for my kid,5
"I cancelled my subscription months ago, and this month they randomly decided to still take my money. Literal worst company/app I could have downloaded.",1
Good to learn,5
Easy to use,5
Knowledge should exist only for those who can afford it. Yeah the lesson are really cool but I'm incredibly broke so I can't finish any of them,2
Wasted money.. useless!,1
brilliantly interactive. lessons are Simple to understand but in no way boring.,5
"Predatory. I was seriously considering subscribing, for a yearly plan, but I'm glad I took my time to make my decision because i did not consent to emails and despite me specifically telling you I don't want them, they still came, again and again. What makes this worse is that the emails are about ""keep your streak going"" which is highly concerning. A company claiming to be all about education, trying to engage me into addictive behaviours, is worrying. I will not be giving you my money or time.",1
"App freezes on S24 Ultra, and the same lecture reloads after finishing sometimes",1
"Sign up doesn't work, takes me back to start screen when I tap on it",1
"Nice app that helps to build up my sagging, aging ego. Lol... It's fun to enjoy a little contest with one's self!",5

Overall app is great. I am facing only one problem the practice part where you access multiple questions isn't showing up in my device.,4
Nice app and a clever way to teach subjects many find dull. ~£15 a month or ~£60 a year is too expensive.,3
"What a helpful app, currently can not afford another semester of college, but this allows me to maintain my mental fortitude.",5
"Love the experience guys, but you could make the formulas pop ups more friendly, already studying and loving the courses",5
Thank you for making your creational app functional!,5

The best educational app there is,5
"Dynamic, always interesting",5
"No words about a premium subscription are ANYWHERE on the app's page, yet when i actually installed and created an account i was expected to pay $160?? Why?",1
It creates an interest to an urge to learn.It does not teach all in one day but helps you a lot in the long run.,5
"Please include the ""x% of people got this right"" feature when you answer a question. You have that feature on the website, but it's not on the app. Please include it.",4
"It really makes me think more about how complicated, interesting and diverse human knowledge can truly be when it comes up to mathematics",5
"Can't sign up using either google or email. It says there was a problem, please try again later. No matter how many times I close and then reopen this app, it doesnt work.",4
I wish there was even more depth but it's very good to get your foundations quickly. Not a ton of practice but efficiency.,5
Very useful with easy to understand diagrams and interactive tools very easy to learn a new subject,5
Awesome platform for knowledge,5
"half of the content ""retired"" ?",1
Great app to get learning again.,5
"What a wonderful app ! tottaly and fully recommended, it helps you think and gain problem solving skills.",5

Very good app,5
I watched a video on YouTube and it leads me to this very brilliant app. Oh it's the app's name! I'm totally in love with it and I'm 100% recommending it to my friends. You saved our lives!,5
It has helped enhance my mathematical skills after being a long time out of a classroom.,5
"Shout-out to the brilliant ppl behind this project. I can imagine the great work put to make education more fun, interactive, and accessible",5
Great application but I'll be glad if they start offering student discounts in vertain regions to make it more accessible due to the price parity,4
"Purchased lifetime subscription, the app is really very constructive in building basics and revising old concepts in mathematics as well as computer sciences",5
Most useful app for those who want to percieve a better inderstanding of scientific thoughts and the beauty of mathematics.,4
"It's a very good way to spend some time, read and learn about a lot of topics, it's amazing, I recommend it.",5
"If it's pricing could be little lower in India, then I'd definitely give it 5 stars Btw great app for learning mathematics and science.",4
"Very nice resource, but too expensive.The people who need this can't afford it, which is a shame.",2
"The site is amazing but facing problems in the app. Daily problems are not loading, please look into it positively.",3
Brilliant. Recommended by my favorite youtubers. Awesome app to pass the time and motivate yourself in learning.,5
I am not able to get premium membership. I tried to pay using my canara bank debit card and also a credit card. I am not able to pay. Please fix it,2

Platform is very interactive with thorough progression sequences. I'm having a lot of fun 😊,5
"So is this the only way to get a response that is not a generic insult to my intelligence... how can you take money on subscription that was already canceled? No email, Twitter or fb reply to that one yet.... DAY 4 SINCE YOU STOLE MY MONEY",1
I like it...an excellent App for brilliant persons...and it can increase your abilities in any science.,5
"Irritatingly gamified. Constant badgering about streaks. This may be useful for some people, for me it's an irritant.",3
Great learning experience! Anyone who loves learning they will love Brilliant's unique approach of qna based teaching,5
So brilliant! It really helps me learn outside of school and allows me to exercise my brain. Thank you so much!,5
A very useful program to learn math without having to read an infinite number of black and white text,5
It's an engaging way to learn and their course material is really in-depth.,5
It gives a very good intuitive base for math and physics.,5
It's brilliant xD,5
"today when i wanted to start a lesson, a screen popped up that told me to buy premium and i couldnt even exit out of the screen. when i pressed the arrow button which is on my phone, it did close the screen but it also closed the lesson. so then i started the lesson again, the screen popped up again. so i guess they really want me to pay like 10 dollars so i can access their lessons. so you think people that pay you 10 dollars can learn infinite stuff but i cant if i dont pay? this app is greedy",1
Please do not remove the Practice feature. It's extremely valuable. I only the premium for it and I'm sure many others do the same.,3
"very cool and educational app, but the process for subscription is ridiculously high at $25 a month",3
"Learn everything you should have learned but hated in school in a smooth, lovely, full of animation world!",5
"This is an amazing app even just to do the daily challenges, which can be quite challenging at times.",5
"Downloaded the app for a few seconds, then deleted it, and months later they try to bill me for $150 dollars. LOL.",1
"It's a nice opportunity for a refresher, and to learn a new thing or two along the way. Great way to spend a little idle time.",5
Love it so far,5
"From the 5 minutes experience I have on the app I'm mind blown... did I just get catfish into thinking this is THE BEST WAY TO LEARN LOGICAL CONCEPTS FOR EFFING REAL?! Time will tell. Love it so far 💯 few days later and yup is sweet af, wish I signed up sooner",5
Bugged. Doesn't let me advanced without buying premium but then premium prices don't load and it doesn't let me even pay,1
"Interesting content, the worst customer service you can find, hope you don't have any issue, because they won't help you.",1
Great app for learning math and science for those who doesn’t have much advantage in School.,5
The application is brilliant but please add a night mode my eyes hurt when I steare at the screen of my phone for long periods of time,4
Lifelong learning!! Stop watching news.. whenever you feel the urge .. solve problems on brilliant!! Thank me later 😁,5
The best app ever. The things that you learn and amount of money you pay is tremendous savings and great knowledge learning!,5
This is an amazing app. I highly recommend it for someone who wants to learn something new and get good grades in school and college level.,5
You wouldn't know it's only very few courses you have access to until you are asked to pay $25 to continue... really heartbreaking.,1
"A powerful, quickly accessible knowledge platform. Great for on the go usage.",5
Does exactly what I hoped it would do. I have yet to learn what the app's revenue model is. No adds so far.,5
"I love this app first I thought It was normal logical app but,it is ver much helpful for learning reasoning question daily I solve one problem it is wonderful app no silly questions from easy quetions tough questions thankyou",5
"Scam. ""Free Trial"" will charge you $130 dollars automatically for the annual fee....even if you don't select that as an option.",1
Interesting app. Lots of things to learn and more importantly how to apply things learnt. Very enjoyable so far.,5
Expensive (wish the month to month was the same as yearly scaled down). Also didn't effect me but researching Reddit resulted in many refund issues / poor policy.,1
"It's an excellent app, I just play six levels because I have no money to pay the subscription but I can't give this app less than 5 stars.",5
Authentic and entertaining courses. Makes you feel competent after finishing course!,5
prime subscription fee us much higher!!! and with only one chapter of every course and community feed is free. But it is nothing...,2
"challenging puzzles to solve, i wish i can get more notifications and to be updated with newer feeds everyday",4
Have just been charged an automatic re-subscribe fee after unsubscribing and deleting it months ago. Didn't actually help improve understanding of maths or science.,1
"Has been fun and challenging at a good pace, best part is if I'm done it's done I just turn it off and start back up again the next day.",5
Bite sized educational tidbuts that have potential to inspire and engage - I use it to stay sharp and find its overall breadth and design to be attractive and clean 🫧,5
"Your extremely expensive plans are unnecessary and unworthy considering the width of your domain. You could have a simpler plan and cost and succeed better, but you choose to have costly plans for most basic science and then spend millions annually on partnerships, like a fооl.",1
Love it so much!!! But I would give a 5 start if only I don't need to go premium to get full services. Hope good things for this app though.,4
"E-mail was flooded with a new wave of advertisements from wal-farts, costco, and target after downloading this app. Must be selling our info.",1
"I love this app, daily challenges keep my mind alert every morning before work, I have been recommending it to my peers ever since.",5
Just wow.... this is the help I've been needing and looking for! The explanations are crystal clear and they make it super fun,5
Great UI and experience. Great way of learning. I can learn forever with this tool. Loved it,5
"I like the way they wait until you've completed your name, email, etc to then tell you how lucky you are to be starting your 7 day free trial, after which you can keep using the app for a pittance of ONLY $99:95 ! Wow how lucky we are.",1
learning should be free excellent content but a monthly subscription is not worth content if it was accredited as college courses it would be worth it,2
"What a great experience. From start to finish, this is truly ""BRILLIANT"" learning journey. I recommend these guys highly",5
No sooner than I make the payment I am unable to login to my app or online or get a response to the two emails that I've sent! Absolutely disappointed!,1
great in depth content with questions that might interest just as much as the answers. Its fun to learn an compete outside of doing homework,5
"If brilliant compromise little bit about annual fee, like 100 SAR. The whole people will paid for them...the annual cost is so high.. That's why I give two star,",2
As the name suggests Brilliant and it's truely a Brilliant app but it'd be convenient if monthly based subscription is introduced...,4
Can't even unsubscribe from the email spam without logging in. Can't be bothered to support a business like that. Just reported it as spam and uninstalled.,1
"It's exactly what it says ( BRILLIANT) IT'S challenging , keep you thinking. Great 4 any n everyone studying. Love it.",5
"So I good and challenging, better than candy crushh. Great way to pass time while working out your brain muscles. Happy I tried. Simon Whistler brought me here.",5
I love the way this app is organised. Very clear and informative. I also appreciate how much you can play before they make you pay!,5
"dope app. started learning to build an automation to resemble the human brain, and now i have to go back and re learn calculus",5
Been trying to sharpen my math skills while learning others. This is hands down the best app for this. Well worth the money.,5
"Every Time I tried to sign up it pops out"" there was a problem.please try again"" I installed this app in 3 different phones but the problem remains the same !",3
So much pleasure from solving the problems. Gateway to make it understandable to understand advanced Algorithm. Just Brilliant😊,5
((Very recommended)) Its hard to find an app that really benefict esp in educating young generation to think out of the contect.,5
"Try first,Excellent free mind booster relax mind excercises with increase english word power ,Advanced pages when u solves the problem u can assume the question ,problem with story mode For subjects",5
"It's a fun and informative app, though for many solutions, it asks for update to premium membership now, which isn't that cool!",4
It's a good app to help with learning skills but you decided to go down the path of overpriced for something that should be readily available for cheaper,3
"It's the challenge of the questions, not necessarily the solutions to the questions (but that's satisfying), which make it all worth while.",5
"The app is lagy and i can barely get the pitctures intothe squares, I don't trust the billing either.",1
Brilliant has a great way of explaining concepts and building your knowledge and skill through problems.,5
"Great app, the only issue is that sometimes the problems for the questions get advanced very quickly.",5
"I would suggest it, to anyone who is looking to learn things as simple as possible, specially MATH!",5
Absolutely best useful great creative productive app that i have ever seen.. recommend to every age group who has at ... least curiosity of 1%.. (mostly for children),5
Do not buy this if you think it will help you pass college courses. I feel completely scammed. This app offers very little for an incredibly high price. Try IXL instead,1
perfect and useful app. teaching. definitely much much more than a stupid game,5
This app is so brilliant like even without getting premium i got so much brilliance. And dont even get me started on the premium courses!,5
Just give more free questions to people like me who can't afford the premium version otherwise it's great for learning cool stuff.,4
"Dislike the new app, I can't find the everyday quizzes , with only the search bar I don't find regular challenges",3
It's very good for learner's as well as people who enjoy spending time with math and mind workout,5
Fantastic App. I am in a STEM career and continue to learn and relearn topics within this app.,5
I don't know why this app is sending data to Facebook IP addresses when I signed in with email. Why would I pay for something that also makes money off my data.,1
"Expensive and the interface has become awful, can't even find the daily challenges now..",1
Perfect for comprehending mathsmatical ideas visually. I cannot wait to try other subjects.,5
Can't wait till they expand on more options. It's like better school and allows me to learn things i like. Awesome stuff,5
That's the kind of app everyone should use. It's perfect!!!!! Unhappily I don't have money to unlock all the puzzles.,5
"I don't mind spending money for apps but not in this model. I refuse your ""free"" trial. You've just lost a likely conversion.",1
The best way to learn physics concept. I just loved it. One of the best investment i made.,5
So far it's been great. Started at the adc levels. Got to refresh some things and am learning a few new things a log the way,5
"Excellent app for quick learning, I only wish it wash cheaper and had more science courses.",5
"I love it but the app doesn't always open the course, I have to reopen a few times or use the web version",3
A great app...Ultimate and Brilliant...Trains your mind in a great way and a great way to develop your brain so you can show off i DO RECCOMEND THIS APP,5
"Nothing is showing free in this app. Whichever module is opened, it shows premium option, to buy.",1
"Plenty of courses with more on the way, two daily problems brilliant is an apt name.",5
"A good teacher, uses practical and simple examples to build understanding of concepts.",4
The Show explanation button is not working and taking us back to the home screen in the mobile app.,3
this is very good app to learn in an effective way to build logical thinking and it boosts your brain to solve complex mathmatical problems.,5
"Interesting concept, however this app doesn't appropriately display on my pixel 3 XL. I can't scroll down to push any buttons.",1
I am amazed at how Brilliant has opened my way of thinking in terms of different ways to problem solve and look at things from a different perspective.,5
"Recommended app for those who want to make their brain effective for exam, daily living, and even at work.",5
"I love the app, its is very explanatory, and I understand everything I'm being taught. I highly recommend this app for any engineering aspirant.",5
You have to sign up after downloading only for this garbage to give you access to a seven day free trail for a paid service you probably didn't want.,1
It is the best educational app that I have ever used . Highly recommend if you want to learn new things in a interesting way,5
"Great app, it really explains things in a way that's easily understood. Highly reccomend for all novice developers, like me.",5
"Some awesome content saddly hidden behind a glitchy app, confusing menu and expensive subscription.",2
"Saw thit app posted most places I watch on YouTube, thought I'd give it a try. Seems pretty good from the start. Lots of math cources, I love it!!",5
Really enjoy it. Not a smart man but I like how the app breaks down concepts to make me feel like I am getting smarter 👍good teachers I suppose,5
"grear app, but only the introductions are free. you need a premium subscription to go past the first chapter of any course.",1
"Excellent, I think it is needed, for all people who want to enjoy learning and understand Concept of math",5
"I love the app it's a very good and training app, it really teaches maths well with computer science fundamentals",5
"The app looks good. It's fun, probably simple for native English speakers. I'm from europe and my level is B1, so I find this app hard to understand. I often don't get ehat dors it want from me, I don't get the explanations because of the hard words...",2
Best method I have used so far. The resource is amazing. Just trying to save some money to learn more in premium.,5
"Crashes everytime I open it, OnePlus 6T, Android 9. So I wouldn't know if its any good or not!",1
Impossible to get ahold of accidentally didn't cancel trying to get money back and they don't answer emails and phone number gose streight to voicemail no matter the time,1
"Can't be used to learn anything without subscription, slow practice, not the best option overall.",1
"All topics of science at one stop,you can excel in science as good as a degree holder in a very low price ,I thank brilliant team for making this wonderful app",5
"Really brilliant app,very informative and fun to learn new things with unique illustrations.",5
Wonderful way to learn. I find the story's about the history of the problems help come to the solutions as you see the reason for this.,5
"In some articles contents are shown in code language, which needs to be taken care of, other than that it's the best training app I've ever seen beside Khan Academy",5
Freaking ripoff. 7 day trial before you have to pay. Even duolingo is free and is a great app. Greedy developers now Adays just want your money,1
One of the best apps out there that actually make you learn. Wide range of topics that are covered in great depth.,5
The pictures wont appear. I have 2mbps net speed and 100ms ping. But still the pictures wont load. And i bought the annual plan.,1
"This is a very helpful way of learning maths,science and computer science The reason why I give it 4 star is because the price of premium is too high",4
Do not sign up for this... I you let the 7 days pass... they charge you for a whole year and there is no way to get that $160 back even if you cancel immediately.,1
Great content. But images are not showing when i use a offline course...,3
Great app and really enjoying the free version. Paid version is just too expensive or I would have taken it.,5
I would like to cancel my subscription but the acount management is somewhat off. I having a hardtime to unsub.,2
I don't know if there are adds. I bought premium and I'm enjoying every single second I spent with this app.,5
Best application for education I bought for my kids and I am using for myself also. There is always room for some mind practice.,5
it's a fantastic app. we can learn so many things even in the free version that I'm amazed! It helps me a lot and I'm totally satisfied.,5
Really helps me understand more about science. It also tells you how you got wrong and how you got right! I might buy a premium!,5
It doesn't load when you go back in the lesson and... IT'S STILL NOT LOADING AND I DID SO WELL and now I'm getting a better app until this one has fixed.,1
"The best free knowledge app to learn different science explanations and mathematics, please add new free courses. Must try.(^_^)",5
Brilliant has quality content that will boost your skills. I love it. Worth the premium. I highly recommend it.,5
This app is really helpful and I'm really fascinated by it. Spending a lot of time learning via the brilliant.,5
I am encountering severe issues while using the app. As soon as I start a lesson it opens and then shut down immediately in a jiffy.,1
Good application so far. Since I bought the Premium access i do at least daily tasks and it enriches the own problem solving skills,5
"Very easy to follow. Even at my old age, am still finding the highschool algebra interesting.",5
Nice UI. But limited content as it focuses on Physics & Mathematics.,4
"this app is really(not a premium subscription guy),it really helped me to increase my IQ nd its actually fun solving daily quiz especially the logical one's.",5
"Have to pay, nothing free - displayed an animation and crashed when I clicked screen. Bye!",1
"I'm currently using the free lessons. If I find Brilliant more useful, I'll get the premium subscription.",4
it would be great if the Brilliant wiki was to be introduced to the mobile app. Its really informative.,4
Nice platform to learn😃,5
"I really enjoy the app for my spare time. Great way to learn, and engage your brain.",5
This app brings out the best out of Students. My name is Favour I am a student and also a web developer. And it is useful for me also.,5
Would be nice if they asked questions the old fashioned way. College exams don't use arrows in place of mathematical symbols.,2
"This is a terrible app. Its so laggy. Its always crashing, freezing and so much gliches!",1
Helped me gain an understanding of computer science. Using this app alongside video tutorials will help you succeed in no time!,5
Amazing app. Bite sized learning. It's fun and educative. Great design as well. Highly recommend it.,5
"Brilliant is the best app I've used for learning quantitative, engineering, and physics type information among several other topics!",5
"In my opinion this app is really brilliant, and I love it it helped me in my mathematics and my science work it helped me understand better",5
Don't even instal this app guys! You will be charged annual subscription and won't receive a refund even if you ask for it at the same minute they charge you.,1
"These guys have vanished my excuses to learn things that used to belong to a university major. With apps like this, it doesn't matter if I'm a history teacher or a lawyer. Push your boundaries!",5
"Excellent to learn fundamentals and concepts, clear and concise lessons!",5
The best app for learning or just remembering courses on Math and Science it is the best app ever if you have premium I got recommended this app by RealLifeLore and its great.!,5
a very good designed to learn from simplest towards study and practical usages. good knowlege source. thanks. keep improving.🙏,5
A great learning app! I feel like I'm able to go back to school again and learn things I'd long forgotten about.,5
"Enjoyable and useful exercises, well thought-out courses. Can recommend!",5
"At the beginning, hard to understand. Later, I cannot stop thinking in this course... I really like it.",5
Amazing courses and simplified structure for learners. Love it!,5
"""Brilliant"" app, but far too expensive for the full version which is a must to do the good courses.",2
Absolutely love the courses!..I've been wanting something like Brilliant for a while. So happy I've finally found it :),5
"Absolutely great, you don't need premium to have fun on this app which makes it the best puzzle solving app in my opinion.",5
App itself is brilliant..studying math concepts through this platform is really interesting.,5
Some of the images are old and low quality. I wish they'd up the quality of their content a bit.,5
It's literally worthless if you don't pay the high monthly fee. There are already competitors like Kinnu on the horizon.,2
I was looking for an app or even for online courses like that. Great that I found it.,5
"was using the app for 2 minutes, asked to rate, gave a quick 5 because im a sucker for a good first impression. Now I'm going to give a 4.",4
Amazing app but the latest update just broke it for me. It crashes after a few seconds of opening,2
"Fantastic, everything is simple to understand and very informative.",5
"I never write reviews, but this platform is worth it. Math and science were never so fun to learn. Loved it!",5
"The app itself is quite nice, though it lacks a black/OLED friendly design.",4
"5/5 without a doubt, not what i was searching for in the play store, but what i definitely needed! Love it",5
Advanced subjects explained in a systematic and intuitive way. Brilliant! 😜,5
"Very important to use this app in my age (50s), as I start to feel deficiency in my mental skills as I'm not practicing logic and mathematics as before",5
really useful for those who are taking physics and computer science.....even there are other STEM(Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) subjects that i dont even know about,5
This is really a brilliant app that can turn anyone into a brilliant just by spending time with it..,5
"Updated to make it more user friendly, challenging even at the most basic of quizzes",5
"It's really a decent app I would have put 5 stars, but I can't figure out. Why the app won't let me continue past the introduction.",4
Great app for Learning new things and facts. ideal for students of every branch.,5
Good Price. Good Content. Good graphics. Good Explanations. And AWSOME channels on YT that further support such scientific Topics such as 3Blue1Brown.,5
"Challenging, educational and a must have app. Helped me to master diverse range of topics. Install it right away.",5
"A great learning experience and it is so accessible for busy people, like myself.",5
"The Brilliant Platform Is Amazing, I Have Been Using Brilliant For 2 Years Now. But The App For Android Is Not Native. I Would Like A Better Experience.",3
"Fantastic way to learn, from the basics to advanced university level.",5
Very good learning app. But it has only yearly plan no monthly plan available.,5
"Awesome UI, intuitive content and takeaways for quick learning implementation!",5
excellent game if you call it that to do problem solving. I really like the logic puzzles,5
I just wanted to say a big thank you to the creators of this platform. Your courses are amazingly laid out appropriately. Good work!,5
Great for problem solvers with a background of science or math that would like to stay sharp & practice their thinking skills.,5
"Just can't pass registration screens. ""Which one is most like you"". Whatever I choose I can't go further. Heard good reviews but I just can't use it.",1
"Nice app. But why there is only a year subscription? I would like to have a choice: month, half a year, year",3
Best application to learn things online with the friendly environment but the need of amount kills number of ultimate downloaders.,4
Love it so much but wow it cost way more that I can afford - it seems unreasonably expensive. Such a shame.,2
Reasonable. I paid for the subscription. Expected more topics though its fairly narrow in scope.,4
"Loved it before buying premium, love it even more after. Great interactability. Big thanks!!!",5
"The very first lesson allowed me to piece together a concept I could never seem to grasp since grade school. Brilliant could not have proved it's ""brilliance"" any better if it had known I was stuggiling.Hooked immediately.",5
I want the prerequisites and the next steps features to be added back. It was really helpful i don't know why they removed it.,4
Nice but quite expensive. Not very affordable for students. Lots of good free stuff though!,5
"Completely worth it This app contains a lot of knowledge, even the free experience is more than enough to get started to the world of information",5
Made me stay up all night learn about maths for fun. Could use a better practice section.,5
Nice toy if you already know how something works. For learning things if you have no prior knowledge - useless.,1
"Briliant app is the best way to learn math ,after struggling with the foundation of math brilliant end my struggle after 2 weeks by using the app",5
"Good app to do something useful with your time while you wait on something, nice little bite size lessons.",5
"Brilliant not so brilliant when they are teaching that gravity is a force, something we've known not to be true since about 1912.",3
Lots of fun Clear graphics. Explanations r clear n if they r not the discussion board is there so you can see how others r trying to understand the puzzle or riddle.,5
Fun way to pass time. Haven't decided if the premium is worth the price (quite expensive).,5
Upon opening a course it fails to load. Don't know if that is a phone issue or a software issue though,3
"A fantastic platform for Math and Science enthusiasts, brimmed with lessons, quizzes and a lot more...!",5
"ever since the update, and the addition of more courses, it feels more and more like this app is the future of self learning",5
One of the best apps for learning that I have ever used,5
The best way to increase your knowledge!! Has Exclusive content that you probably can't find anywhere else. I love it so much as it has stuff out of the box. Nothing is better.,5
"This app is very good and you can spend your time in the bus, or train to do it. Don't forget to check the station . lol",5
"It is fun, entertaining, and educational. It does cost money for some study but if you can afford it it's worth it",5
"The app is fun, but cost is generally too big for a citizen of a developing country. It is quality stuff for those who can afford it.",4
this is the best app I've ever had. Excellent for students and for people who just want to practice science and feel like a pro.,5
It should be possible to do the trial without giving card or payment information. Very off-putting. Deleted.,1
Very good and easy app to learn deeply in the easy way complicated subjects. Great app.,5
Amazing app......really easy and fun to use..... you could really learn and visualise things like never before...overall a great app,5
I have never found so much pleasure in learning till I discovered brilliant! . The appropriate learning tool of our era. Thumbs-up!!,5
"Whole thing is a lie. You can't learn ""unlimited"" amount of material how it where described on the Website, because later parts of the courses are still BLOCKED",2
Great for people who wish to learn in a practical way. Great mobile learning experience,5
app is easy to use and it provide good topic. each topic cover in details with puzzle is great for biggner to learn from this app.,5
"what ever you don't leave without downloading this progi - i have just started checking it contents out, and it has already blown my head clean off (but in a good way!!!)",5
"Stole my money I have signed up for a monthly fee, and they charged me £83 all at once. I would advice anyone not to put their bank details in there. You dont get what you signed up for.",1
"Wow. This app has really cool and rare content in one place. If you are a learner, you are going to enjoy it every single day.",5
"I have only taken one coarse so far so take it with a grain of salt, I have learned alot more than I was expecting and love coming back to challenge my mind and determination.",5
"of course it is very good, but how can i change the language. this bring a lot trouble to finish questions",4
No star rating. Installed app multiple times...does nothing when you open app. Don't waste your time on this one!!!,1
Its unfortunate that such awesome knowledge comes at such a high price of a couple hundred dollars. Even 10 a month isnt worth it. Lol monthly payment lol,1
"Great app, do you offer a monthly subscription? Yearly a bit too costly in current climate.",5
"The premium subscription is too expensive, I want it but unfortunately I can not afford it , you can lower the price in india and play the economy of scale.",1
"It does a tremendous job of fueling a love for maths and logical thinking, so useful for making maths accessible and practicable",5
ok yeah ill be doing dishes till I'm dead for a premium subscription but this is absolutely brilliant. ok dont jump on to the pink fluffy stuff at home and use this,4
What about people who are interested in biology or geography ??? It will be more better if you added biology or geography... Good luck ... Wish you all the best.,3
The experience is great. I came here from u tube after seeing brilliant on Kurzgesagt-in a nutshell channel,5
Offline not available - Would have been great if I could download a specific unit and learn it offline. Dark mode not available,3
Tried charging the card for an annual subscription. Even when I canceled the app after the trial period. Be careful,1
Add more to algorithms and data structure it's so less in the course just some basic parts are covered,1
Love it but lacks dark mode. The white background really eats the battery on my amoled screen and burns into my retina at night,4
"laid back and fun, yet cerebral and intense at the same time. anyone who loves learning should download this app.",5
"Works very well. Some performance issues on a 4 yo phone, but nothing major.",5
"To many reviews with problems on money, features of the app, and learning. There is a lot of 5 stars with short answers. Be warry of this app.",1
"I really want to love this app, But the app is lack of practicing and explanations. Kahn is still the best place to learn math",1
"At the initial levels, so far so good. Does seem to have a nice learning curve to it",5
"Love this app, every subject is transfered simpely in a way that anyone can understand, i bought it and would buy it again!",5
I gave it a 4 star 🌟 rating because I think it has a lot of potential as an app. I can't play for some reason. But I've seen how learn full it can be. But this app isn't for me anyways :'),4
In decision tree only half of the pictures could be seen and in logarithms the questions are in the form of script. How do you expect ys to read and understand it,1
$30/month is laughable! There's plenty of free resources you can find online that will teach you these concepts. Ridiculous 🐷,1
Where all the education systems are being dorment on their duty. App like this keeps the philosophy alive. I loved the concept and idea. Of this app. This app should be made part of the science education as a test to grow intiution among people.,5
Nice Brain Excercise App I highly recommend to the user that if you interested in maths and science. Then please install the app it will enhance your thinking capacity!!,5
very nice app but sad it's paid but very nice tricks and there is learning and knowledge try to get it free you can add ads we not have problem try if you can,5
STAY FAR AWAY Terrible site. I have tried to contact on several occasions to cancel my trial but no response.,1
...simply brilliant. I enjoy a lot how its content is delivered and how it stretches my mind.,5
If there was a possibility of -5 star rating I would have gone for it. It's a completely dumb app trying to look like cool maths app.,1
"The pricing in USD is far from applicable for customers in other countries - I myself would happily pay ~50 Reais on a monthly subscription, but 25USD is plainly unfeasible",2
Make more courses free because it's very limited without subscription and I feel like I'm not learning as much as I can.,3
Really feel my deep understanding of why mathematical concepts work have increased thanks to following these courses and solving problems daily.,5
I think that when a person is singing in it quite hard This app helps you to learn more about Mathematics and science english computer.,5
Forgot to cancel my free trial and instead of it becoming a monthly subscription they bill me for a whole year ? Dont get scammed...,1
"Too expensive. In order to test the app, i have a 7 day trial and then OPT OUT. This made give up from even trying out the app.",1
Brilliant is brilliant... Loved this the best miscellanious app for building skills and excercising concepts.. Just amaaaaazzziing,5
I didn't expect it to be this good. One of the best apps to learn mathmatical or logical consepts on. You cab tell the spp was made by people who love the subjects.,5
"3 days of using premium and I love it. Only drawback I found is lack of dark theme, would love to see it",5
Need to make free some more contents for the third world countries. The rest was amazing!,5
"Playstore says this app is free, but it is not, it's a £97 annual subscription. I'm sorry but that is far, far too expensive",1
"The lessons and course are really excellent, and this is a breakthrough discovery.",5
I really appreciate this application. I think it is essential for young students to learn by thinking. Learn by seeing. Learn by asking...,5
A great app for learning. Learning without thinking is useless. This apps encourages us to learn by thinking.,5
I love the challenges and theoretical questions that this app gives me. I feel like I can discuss and learn alot.,5
Best math app I've seen ... Hannah Fry and colleagues have done a superb job. The school and college fun revisited. Better than sudoku.,5
Haven't studied math other than basic arithmetic in over 40 years. Brilliant is helping me enjoy getting reacquainted.,5
There are more questions than explanations on concepts. How would a beginner solve them without enough explanation,2
There are some minor bugs with the app but for the most part this is an amazing learning tool.,5
Just started on it. Seems to be an upright app. Follows an escalating path that feels real good.,5
Very nicely structured lessons and good interface but no dark mode so I'll only give it 4 stars,4
"I like the explanations , They're easy to understand. This helped with my school works. Thenks for making it",5
"They are charging 9.99. (if) annual.. they have a monthly plan that they laugh in your face with at $25 a month. So they assume you'll just purchase the year, crazy.",1
The examples and exercises are very practical and easy to understand,5
App works very well. Starts simple and gradually gets more difficult.,5
"I love this app,But it would be nice if they include gcash as a billing payment;because in SE asia Gcash it is pretty popular,I'm having hardtime to subscribe for every month.",5
Really good way to learn complex but important topics in a very intuitive way,5
"Horrible app. All of their content is free elsewhere. They're trying to capitalize off of people's desire to learn by gatekeeping information behind a paywall. ""You're too poor to learn""",1
"brilliant education philosophy, well written and engaging problems and courses. Worth supporting with a subscription",5
"Account deactivated for no reason. And no reply from support team just one line ""your account has been deactivated for content scrapping"". Why?",1
Does not support landscape orientation - very painful to use it on a tablet.,3
"Ages 10-110, but my son can't sign up because he's under 13... It's a good app, but that issue in sign up needs fixing",3
The best app I've ever came across. It's basically what's your critical thinking which is great cause I'm still a student,5
"Only drawback I can find is you dont see the scorings of others users in the app, which are visible when using the website.",5
If you could design talk back system it could be more interesting and helpful... this app is perfect for knowledge seekers...,5
Just started using this app and i already love it! The fact that its interactive and simply designed makes it so much fun to learn with.,5
"Great learning and expanding games. Easy to get into, hard to master.",5
this app is a wonderful one and anybody can understand the topics in them but the only problem is that the premium cost more,4
"Courses are often hidden behind a paywall after you finish a part of them, you either buy it or leave it unfinished.",1
I love logical and mathematical puzzles. Working on my math skills towards understanding quantum physics.,5
I wish it was free. I love the free things so much!!!! Soon I will get the premium but alas learning isn't free🙃,5
fun and exciting way of tackling a wide variety of scientific subjects ( plus the daily problems are great ) 😊👍,5
Best way to revise arithmetic concepts,5
"it is very good app for problem solving of maths, physics, computer science.",5
This app is too good but i dont have money to buy premium can anyone give me premium I need this plz😢 and I also don't have money to get into class this app is only a thing.,5
"Amazing! It's the app I've been looking for to fill those in-between moments in the day. Can't get enough of it. Haven't tried the premium yet, but I will definitely buy it if it ever drops in price.",5
Great problems and explanations!! Been loving it since I don't encounter good logic problems any more (post-grad),5
As name suggests it is a brilliant app..! Love u guys of brilliant.. u support educational videos on YouTube that's again a good thing.,5
This is a great site for self learners. It presents scientific theories and implementation in a very interesting way.,5
brilliant really provides a whole new dimension to certain aspects of life with their hand curated questions. loving it!,5
Simply amazing! If you want to see the fun side of maths you should totally give it a try.,5
Great these apps should be supported great experience great content great explanations great problems for anyone you'll definitely learn something 😃😃😃😃,5
the app is very lag for android. the virtual keyboard mostly not responsive.,3
Love love love this app. I cannot recommend it enough. The games and lessons in it are so educative and helpful,5
"My phone hanged two times , I have to restart it .It gets freeze as soon as I open geometry basics . Help me developers Mobile - realme c3",1
Exceptional. I wish there was one time payment or lower price for premium,4
A really good app that makes your brain do some critical thinking everyday. You will learn a lot with this app.,5
"Beautifully conceived app, amazing tool to teach concepts in easy and enjoyable manner",5
"Would be 5 stars if they had a place to go, pick a subject and just answer as many practice questions as you want.",4
I haven't even purchased a premium subscription to this app yet but wow the content available for free is wonderful.,5
"Brilliant app for learning, but the fact that it's a yearly payment and not montly , is making me and any more, hesitant whether to purchase it or not.",3
Brilliant org is the world 's best self study learning app. it helps to learn in intellectual understanding and improves critical and creative thinking.,5
Definitely the best platform to gain comfidence in STEM subjects. I feel smarter after every lesson.,5
Enjoyable to learn through brilliantly broken down subject parts. Pedagogically very effective.,5
Courses aren't explained properly. Analogies given are confusing. They do not go deep in the lessons,2
Really fun...It is really great to have a platform which is making problem solving really fun....The best I have found 😁😁,5
I enjoy Brilliant and this app. I would recommend to people who would like to learn state of the art tools and techniques,5
"I like it generally, but wish it had a dark mode - I find it blinding. I would use it more...",4
"The content was good, but the gamification/streak features ruined the app for me. I hate them too much to use it.",1
Absolutely recommended if you want to learn faster and easier than the traditional ways.,5
An educational app for those of us who desire a little brushing up on the basics we learnt in school.,5
"Fun game, I'm loving the Logic puzzles to keep my mind sharp. (sideNote: I'm just using the Free version)",5
Would be 5 stars if there was a dark mode option (black not white background) so I could use at bedtime more comfortably!,4
I love the fact that i can learn a variety of topics at my own pace without even taking a class.,5
Lots of subjects to choose from in depth description and great to ise for learning touch base later,5
"Application is wonderful BUT is it so hard to add several languages? to increase the usability and number of users, I really want to learn and I found quality information but I don't know the language and because of this I completely lose the motivation to do anything",3
This app is an honest revolution in visual learning. How I wish my school teachers taught concepts using these visuals,5
Brilliant is brilliant to use not needing me to leave a review. I hope everyone can contact great education one day.,5
I just want to learn but not being able to finish a lesson without being told to pay I know you want to make money but don't do it like that and 120 dollars a year is a lot for an app,2
It says it costs 83.85 but when you go to pay its 119.85??? I can understand that it's because of Google's cut but it's still false advertising,2
"I love this app! I heard about Brilliant when a YouTuber promoted it, and ever since, I've been hooked.",5
"great app, perfect for beginners who want to learn and masters of a skill who want to freshen up.",5
Who thought learning maths could be such fun? This is an excellent learning app. Highly recommended,5
"perfect, but I have one issue. I can't buy premium subscription. I have a card added to my account, but the app wants me to pay with another account, that doesn't have a card added",4
This is a god sent for students. Effective students are always learning so download this app and get learning.,5
Gears lesson 4 seems to be stuck at loading. I can't get past the loading screen with it.,4
Please I've just finished one level and I don't to go to the level 2 but the app is really good.,4
If you love to learn for learnings sake this is where it's at. If your looking for bite sized but quality education I know no better app.,5
Just brilliant as it says... The exercises really help me to get my mind out of the box.,5
Fun so far and true to form! only 4 cause I haven't been using it very long and can't say for sure.,4
Great lessons that are engaging and follow a logical progression.,5
Excellent app! Finally making progress in math as an adult learner. Thanks a lot!,5
very interesting and useful this app is literally a masterpiece hope more courses to be added and remains free,5
Really cool. Except we both gave an incorrect answer for the triangle in the Infinite Areas section.,5
"Good but not for everyone, there should be a guid ( a parent or teacher ) for beginners to clarify mathematics doubts...",5
"it is a very fantastic app to train our brain everyday, it helps us to feed our knowledge with the fruit of information",5
Great way to make learning fun and convenient! Recommending to all my smart friends!,5
Awesome app. Every problem is unique in its nature. Recommended for every science and maths enthusiast.,5
no idea how to delete account. I downloaded the app and wish to uninstall. I didn't even try free trial.,1
"The app itself is fun, but they cancelled my subscription (offered at a discount for 48h) without any explanation🤷🏻‍♀️",4
"Do not download by any means. This application has taken advantage of many who wish to better their knowledge by unlawfully taking money without proper consultation of the client, many of which are minors. This application withdrew over $170 from my account, which is over 90% of the available funds of the account. Beware of the fraudulent activities of this app. Please report any activity of fraud to your respective banks' fraud division, and report the application to google.",1
The app is so amazing! The user experience is smooth. Kudos to the team:)),5
It's really the best learning app you can get from people aging from 12+ till death,5
Very good platform to learn things and develop an interesting and ever seen before way of learning,5
This is a great application .So informative and it enables me to view science from another positve perspective .,5
It really needs to be more affordable. Im sure hundreds of thousands of people will be able to make the subscription including me.,4
It deserves a full 5 stars recommended for everyone sort of only use if u know to read properly soooo can add a text to speech on it brilliant devopers? Just saying,5
"Simple to use, great source for real problem solving without a gimmick.",5
Easy and engaging. I like that it only takes about 5 minutes or less for each mini lesson,5
"Great app! I has some little issues, so I contacted the developer which fixed the issues very fast",5
Most of the important stuff they say is coming soon.. very expensive for what is available from them..I cancelled the subscription,1
Decent app but basic courses. Was not notified that trial was ending as promised and charged for a year.,2
It could be addictive if you're into mathy problem solving or puzzles. I like this app.,5
Interesting daily problems to solve. Solution discussion with other users helps in understanding the sciences.,4
"Brilliant is a brilliant app! It is so much fun, educational, and easy to understand.",5
Creative and interesting way to learn ! But the app membership is quite expensive.,4
The content is definitely good. My problem is that I am unable to save my progress in the app. Please fix this.,3
I enjoy the variety offered. Short lessons that explain the topics well.,5
Lacks dark mode,4
Best learning app I've found so far :) and it's reasonably priced so that it doesn't break the bank 🏦,5
So disappointing ..nutting showed on the exercise but blank pages so I removed it I was looking forward to it .. you guys need to work on your page bugs,1
The app is good. many challenging challenges that make your brain think deeply. Very awesome,5
Great content. I just wish it were more affordable. There should be government subsidies for this quality.,5
"It is a great way to kill time, fun yet challenging if you like maths",5
This app tends us to think. The problems are simply amazing. This helped a lot in enhancing my deep thinking. Thanks to the app developers.,5
the name says it all. Great topics for learning put into great and easy to learn chunka,5

Superb!!! Education will change from universities to just an smart device and this app shows how it is to be done.,5
A great app to use for inquisitive mind. Good while waiting around on a chair for a long time.,5
I'm an engineering professor and this really keeps me sharp on a variety on technical topics! great app,5
wants your bank details. its only a 7 day trial🧐👎. every other app ive come across manages to make its money by advertising so that people without money can experience free apps. so....,1
It is an amazing learning app I am grade 7 but I am fascinated in grade 9 and above this has helped alot.,5
It is a very engaging and well explained app that can cater to many abilities and interests.,4

"It's amazing, it's awesome to have access to it, all though I definitely prefer the original logo",5
Need help getting my money back after testing the app/website for 1 day. I then deleted the account but was still charged today for a service I literally didn't use. Anyway if anyone can help please do 😔,1
"Various approaches in science, some very original. I don't have much time because i have young kids but i'm still in it.",4
"Keeps you sharp and it has elegant puzzles, too hard sometimes but the challenge is invigorating.",5
Dark theme does not work correctly. Font colors are dark also when you are using dark mode.,3

"Great platform you learn step by step and increase knowledge every day, user friendly. I really appreciate the work behind the wheel big thank to the brilliant team 👍",5
Please give the whole service for free to students. Many can't afford it. Education should be for everyone but unfortunately all cant afford it. Pleaseeeee help,4

"Great content, scaffolding, and helpful animations/visuals (appropriately timed humor as well)",5
My Experience with the Layout is excellent and all the ways of explanation are Best.,5
"This app uses incorrect assumptions, false arguments, and incomplete information to teach, made up puzzles that are logically inconsistent.",1
Really high quality and engaging. Not sure yet about the breadth of content,5
"Can it be offline?It is because I couldn't use WiFi outside.Also,why free members can not access to FULL courses?????Hope you can take this matter into consideration",3
Thank you so much to this brilliant app.. you helped.me pass my online course and I will recommend this amazing app to everyone that I know. Thanks again,5
"Hi guys, why do I see a blank white screen instead of the majority of the courses? I can't even see the courses I downloaded. Can somebody help me please?",2
"With the free option you can't do anything. If you're not paying, you're not playing. And I heard that they charge you even if you cancel the trial. 👎",1
Guys I request you to please include dark theme for this. It will be really helpful as my eyes hurts while brain storming in dark environment. Edit: Uninstalled since no dark mode for ages.,5
Great app...there are quite a lot of things to learn....I would like to request the App Authority to add many new things....Thank you :),5
"Figured I'd give it a new try, one star remains but for a different reason. Honestly what people are your target brilliant?",1
Fun way to blow off old cobwebs!,5
I didn't expect to be useful learning app,5
I am very happy about downloading and using this app as it explains me concepts not directly but by twisting the manner of learning interestingly 🤠🤠,5
"I'm loving the app. Super didactic, it's helping me to improve my math intuition.",5
Refreshing interactive learning materials and app experience is good.,5
Best Application for Learning 👍. The question are very conceptual and is applicable in our day to day life,5
Great app. Although I feel a dark theme would've been better for the eyes and battery,5
concise /kənˈsʌɪs/ adjective: Giving a lot of information clearly and in a few words; brief but comprehensive. Try some of these apples!!!!,1
"I'm giving up on math cause of this app I paid 200$ for it and all it's doing is making me feel dumb and frustrated, and letting me skip ahead anyway what good is that",1
"I'd love to send a photo, however; practice/cryptogram-introduction/?p=6 the answer provided was marked incorrect when it wasn't E=7",3
don't install if you don't want to pay for a subscription. without it the app is basically useless! ❤️❤️❤️,1
Great courses and well put together content. Highly recommended :),5
Pretty cool so far this is my first time using it so I don't know it the cost is worth it.... But then again can you really put a price on knowledge...?🤔 Still undecided but I'll update this post when I do decide just using the trial version so far,4
Enjoyed it until I saw the subscription. I would gladly pay for an app like this but it is just way too expensive.,3
An easy to use app linked to a highly educational program in science and mathematics.,5
Excellent app for intuitive thinking and also good for students. Try this app for sure.,5
Great app It helped me learn more then I ever learned in school I'm 14 and I can explain special relativity But I still can't spell,5
"i applied for premium subscription, money got debited but none of the modules are unlocked to use. customer care dont respond",1
Excellent learning tool and a great springboard into deeper learning.,5
The plans are too costly for me and without paying only the first chapter of each course is unlocked.,2
The app that changes the thinking of your brain in different ways than usually you know.This definitely improves your brain functionality.,5
Brilliant app makes me restart from grade school(the most important educat) which are branched off into many professions.,5
A Fun Learning Experience,5
"This is an excellent app for learning about physics, math, and problem solving.",5
This is easily my favorite app. It is very mentally stimulating and satisfying. I'm learning a lot.,5

Great app easy to use less than 20 a month. Forget a dating site learn math here and tutor at your local college.,5
It's a bit buggy at times but it's doing an amazing job explaining fundamental principles,5
"Good idea, bad execution. Besides the insane cost to subscribe, there's coding errors",3
I really like how it explains things simply! It makes it easier to understand wit such simple steps!,5
Best free app,5
A lot more helpful than most textbooks I've used! Great mix of application and math.,5
Love the content and the interactive questions. I just wish it was narrated.,4
Great learning bites on a diversity of STEM topics. Delivered in a simple and relatable to day to day life manner,5
"Best app for learning math, physics and all related tech subjects.",5

"Absolutely love Brilliant. It's fun, interactive and Information actually sticks",5
definitely not worth the price and no free option with ads or limited lessons.,2
Good app but it opens and works very slowly. I can't open it for 10min so I deleted this app and installed it again,1
When I try to open app just putting me loading screen forever after resetting app settings I can open but later same problem when close app,4
"Excellent app that makes complex topics more engaging and, most important of all, FUN",5
I like the app,5
"Really nice educational app, just wish it had more lessons, but overall its perfect",5
They force you to buy annual plan. The fees of monthly subscription is really hight and it's sad,1
Great program haven't gotten into the hard stuff but it's simple and effective,5
"Great stuff, one of the best learning apps for the specific branches of science it offers",5
"Won't even lode. I'm stuck on the lodging screen, and it won't even open",1
its very helpful and useful for me training with this app is is simple thanks for your afford learn something very interesting thanks,5
Very small amount of courses for the subscription price that you have to pay to have access to them,3
As a college student I am not good with math taking algebra in the fall this app is a good way to prepare you,5
"Best app to learn, I'm only on level 1-1.2 but I'm having fun and it's interesting",5
This is my first time downloading the app and it crashes whenever I open it,2
"Very good app to learn or study math, programing and more!",5
"Just amazing, I wish I could had been able to aford it's premium version",5
"It's nice coming across this awesome and interesting app, guys, keep it up!",5
App won't open it just sits on the loading screen.,2
This is the brilliant way to enhance your knowledge. Great work 👍👏!!,5
Best intellectual Learning App in interactive mode for all Ages,5
I highly suggest adding night or dark mode to use the app at night please.,4
"App is stable, all the courses are so interesting!",5
Not free. It's a free seven day trial. Very disappointed at the marketing for this.,1
It an App. Makes you smart. Like for real no choice. Forces brain to work better,4
What an amazing app. Only thing missing is dark mode to read while on dim lights. Please guys!,4
Learning makes people to explore more and effective . Just brilliant trying ensures this,5
if only the premium subscription could be cheaper and paid monthly instead in a yearly basis,4
"Keeps you on your toes, makes you flex the brain muscle, great explanations when wrong.",5
Very accessible high quality interactive courses! With this you don't even need school probably,5
Those who want to really understand the fundamental of maths and physics.... BRILLIANT does it.,5
It was great 👍 but I having to pay wasn't,4
Using this app is a best thing you can do for improve yourself in science and stuff like that. Its a little bit expensive but absolutely worth it,5
It would have been better if it was we can unlock courses by watching 100 or so ads,5
"This app is absolutely BRILLIANT. Challenges your intuition, widens your scope of possibilities and change your perspective of how to tackle the problem.",5
"I've been waiting a long time for you all to lower your damn subscription price because I'm still broke and I still cant do this $160 nonsense. Anyway, get over yourselves-",3
This app is amazing! I wonder if my kids will struggle with it as much as I do? But I'm kinda a puzzle builder so I'm enjoying this!,5
THIS IS AMAZING. I love it. But I want free learning because I am a student. And please make it free for students. 😃😃😃😍😍😍.,5
"Never afraid of maths again, thankyou brilliant and team🥰, good job. Keep up and thanks for helping 😘.",5
"Although this app is very good , you must pay after some stages. But at total it is amazing.",5
"Enjoyable, gives a nice amount of content for free and a huge amount for those who pay.",5
Good app for learning about cs and logic,5

"I love the app, u can learn so much!! I never write reviews usually but this app is just perfect :)",5
What a downgrade logo. Everything else is perfect.,3
The Brilliant App is a wonderful way to learn more about all sorts of skills you can apply to the real world.,5
Some problem is being shown in the app in my phone. When i open a problem it directly shows the solution,1
Its a fun and interactive way to grasp new concepts.,5
The game changer app !! I just love it !! Must have if you are using any smartphone rather than any other awkward app !!,5
"Too expensive for Brazilians or anyone who lives in a country that adopts a currency worth less than the U.S. dollar. An App built essentially for users from the United States, Europe and the Persian Gulf.",1
"Shouldn't cost a subscription fee if there isn't an active teacher, should be a one-time cost.",1
high five for the app put the cost is not good as per in india if u want more subscription then you need to reduce the price,5
"Incredible, I learn more with this application than I did in many public state school courses. It's... Brilliant 🤏😔🫱Pun...",5
Useless without paid subscription. Low rating not because of content but beacuse how very misleading the provided discription of the app was.,1
"Love this! Great problems and easy, smooth interface.",5
Because most brilliant courses are for premium not for free so if they would make it free then it would be very nice,3
"Really good teaching tool, and enjoying the challenges very much!",5
"In a world full of unclarity and lies, Brilliant is full of clarity and truth. Power to you Brilliant!",5

"No criticism from me, but I do wish it had a psychology course 😊 it's a great app for learning new skills.",5
Paid for yearly premium money got debited but did not recieve the premium nor can I see the transaction on my google play what do I do next?,2
I think it's very useful for visual learner and kinstetic learner.,5
There's nothing free 😮‍💨,1
This is my favorite app of all time. Nuff said,5
Most useful app I've downloaded in a while,5
Sry but I don't get to experience anything. What the app do is just kicking me off when I pressed on random classes,1
It is wonderful learning with this app. I am looking forward to the lessons every day so much.,5
"Very good to learn a broad variety of diverse topics, or at least wet your toes so to speak.",5
the app is great but there are no courses that can help you learn how to multiply or divide,4
"One thing I'm missing a lot is some kind of knowledge check at the end of the lessons. Also, it's too expensive.",3
"I'm pleased with an opportunity to refresh . Everyone , should try to refresh ! It's pleasing .",5
Absolutely wonderful. Just the right amount of teaching and fun.,5
I love it!,5

Premium cost is too high. If it is half I will sure purchase the annual premium pack.,3
"It wants you to pay either 120$, or 25$ per month before it will teach you anything substantive. Plenty of better, free apps out there.",1
"Amazing visuals, teaching and overall experience would definitely recommend",5
"Pretty good soo far, the only problems I encounter are because of me, because I would often overthink some of the questions.",5
So far this a great tool for refreashing lost skills and I look forward to learning new things,5
Totally love it but I gave it four starts because you have to pay to do more but it's so good totally recommend this.,4
"My mind was calmy,pure, I saw tricks and strokes deferent design shapes but struggling to understand. Infinity creation: this is what I thought",5

Excellent app for learning I just wish we could get one full course for free :),5
"The app would be even better without the premium version, but I understand that they are trying to profit off of it somehow.",5

Very boring & not very educational at all. (Yawn) Almost puts me to sleep.,2
premium subscription is not worth it. the course is only introductory to the topic.,2
"very neat app with lots of cool topics, but a little pricey in my opinion for the subscription",3
"Really liked the introductory courses, the premium account is too expensive for me :(",3

Great app for learning coding! I forgot to use his code but Patrick Boyle introduced me to it.,5
Brilliant app! Just add consistency and you too can be brilliant!,5
First they make you register. After that you have to pay. No clear description of payments before registering the account.,1

Brilliant os brilliant but I think it will be better if the coding environment is there on mobile app as well,5

great if you could a little bit more courses on common things like mobile phone sim card internet psychology etcetera,5
A very great app but i wonder why some animations that shows in the laptop doesn't show up in my phone,5
I have loved Brilliant for years. It's an unmatched self-learning tool!,5
Full of glitches! I can even finish the 1st lesson with out one making it impossible yo answer! They gust make it so I can even put an answer in the box!,1
I'm actually in middle school (junior high) and I understand most of the things here because of how brilliant (pun intended) this app is,5

I could not subscribe to premium services. It says I have insufficient balance.,1

I am thoroughly enjoying this amazing app. All of the material is well laid out and explained in simple terms. Awesome!,5
No new lesson on python has been realesed since i got the subscription. That course is incomplete,4
I think you can explain better the subjects if you reconstruct the content of courses,5

The explanations are very easy to follow. This app helped me improve my mental maths.,5
Brilliant app with a brilliant approach to work yourself towards brilliance in several fields.^^,5
This app is such fun problem solving! Tailors to ones' tastes and is encouraging and engaging.,5

"Додаток для допитливих дітей та дорослих, що прогуляли школу. На екрані можна ""помацати"", посовати, позмінювати майже все, чому ви навчаєтеся. Після таких лекцій дуже важко забути бодай щось з пройденого матеріалу. Якщо ваша дитина не має можливості повноцінно навчатися з вчителем через війну з росією, цей додаток, можливо, зможе привити дитині цікавість до шкільних предметів та визначить її майбутнє. Втім, звісно, справжні підручники викидати зарано - у застосунку лише базові речі.",5

"Ich habe kein Geld ausgegeben. ich habe 80% von Computer Science gemacht. Man entwickelt durch diese App keine coding Skills, ich selbst bin Anfänger und das hat sich durch die App nicht geändert. Außerdem ist die App kaum pädagogisch ausgeklügelter als ein xbeliebiger Gratis Online Kurs. Man braucht für eine Lektion teilweise über 20 min und meistens bestehen diese aus Text und ein paar Illustrationen, praktische Übungen sind nur selten, manchmal wird bloß eine Frage mit 3 Antworten gestellt.",3

Tolika kolicina znanja na jednom mestu, ogromnog kvaliteta, je stvarno biser u beskrajnom pustosu koji net nudi.

"Это лучшее, что может быть для обучения новым скиллам. Купил подписку на сайте, а потом уже нашел приложение и установил - удобно, всегда под рукой, хотя в основном обучаюсь с компьютера. Около 400 руб в месяц - смешная цена за такой высококлассный материал. Сколько раз пытался изучить программирование, теорию вероятности, физику, но при виде книг и формул - нападала тоска и уныние. А с помощью этого сайта нашел для себя рецепт обучения. В общем мне офигенно зашло. Спасибо разработчикам!",5

"Even without premium, this app is amazing! There are so many topics, and the questions are always simple with a clear focus and lesson to be learned from. I highly recommend it, however I have not tried the premium, because right now I am satisfied with the free courses. I will definitely consider getting it in the future.",5

"I love this app. But it sucks because its paid. Why can't there be a app 
that's educational and helpful and not try and bleed your wallet? Yes, I 
know thease things cost money. Getting the information, professional 
educators cost money, and building an app cost money. But learning should 
be free in any format. If you have something new and innovative and people 
actually love it. Ask for donations. Partner with professionals that are 
wanting to make an impact on the future. Well atleast I know next time 
someone asks me a question I'll give a partial answer and then ask for $7 a 
month. That's sarcasm for those who may or may have not caught it. All in 
all. Love the app but hate the random mention of paying a monthly fee. 
Great for supplimental learning, re-learning, or people that like problem 
solving.",3
"Exactly as the title says, BRILLIANT app. It challenges me every day, it deepens my knowledge and makes me overcome my limits in math and science! I used many methods for learning, textbooks, online resources, but no one compares even a tiny bit to this app. This app is the example of how excellent active learning can be. Wanna learn in the best, fastest, and most effective way? This app is for you, just a hundred dollars a year for the premium subscription and is one of the best things you will pay for.",5
"Great ideas, good app, but a dumb pricing model. You buy books to reference 
them and go back, but this is a subscription. You should be able to buy 
certain topics and keep them forever, and then have a subscription as a 
separate choice, not the only way to learn anything valuable.",3
"You have to be over 16 to use this app? What kind of bs it this? I am 13, with a great mind, and want to put my knowledge to the test! Just because it's older people who know more about math than minors, doesn't mean all minors are idiots who don't know a thing about algebra. I really do find this offensive, even for me.",1
"I'd love more solutions to be free, but still, it's a great app. I get to 
refresh my knowledge and learn new things, via quizzes and the read-only 
content. Plus it works perfectly, it hasn't crashed not even once.",5
Just brilliant!! Easy bite-sized chunks of information is fed to you in a well structured manner. Not enough to study for exams though but is good if you are just curious. I went through algorithm introduction and it was really well structured and easy to understand. Well done brilliant.,5
"I really like the way this is set up. Helps to make learning alot easier. Hoping to relearn all of the math and science that I neglected in my younger years. So far so good, use it everyday.",5
"Greatly paced education with engaging puzzles along the way. Also, the snippets of topics are clear and simple to understand. If with subscription comes the promise of ever expanding quality content to learn from, I'm in.",5
"Love this app! So much to learn, and I think it offers a fair amount of free content. Definitely worth subscribing if you enjoy the multiple subjects they have.",5
This is actually very useful for me. My only concern about this app is that the interactive graph does not load. Is there anything I can do to get rid of this inconvenience?,3
"One of the best apps I ever found. Learning computer science has become so 
much easier with this app. The science (biology/chemistry) course is so 
interesting too. Amazing, easy to use, hands-on method. Really recommend to 
anyone who wants to improve their knowledge and skills.",5
"As a life long learner this is great app to see progress through the years. 
Also find myself filling in a ton of knowledge gaps despite being an A 
student through my academic career. Great for all skill levels, and I like 
the warm up exercises and problems of the week. Keep up the great work.",5
"Really love this app, especially since the last update to the UI. Looking 
forward to the upcoming courses. Well done for somehow making math even 
more fun than usual.",5
"Great for people who want to hone their math and physics skills. If you enjoy problem solving, definitely worth a download :)",5
Requiring my creating an account before I can see what your app does results in a one star review and removal from my phone. I won't trade my PII witjiut knowing what I get in return.,1
Love it. Easy way to brush up on topics or learn new things anywhere you are. I wish all my math courses could be taught this way.,5
Great way to learn new things that I've never questioned before. Like the fridge and toilet. Great app if you are trying to know more about anything 😎,5
"Brilliant app! :D If only the hints were hidden like spoilers are in forums 
though... They sometimes just solve the puzzles for you. But still, it's a 
fun app!",5
"I've always wanted to have a chance of being good at physics. Now I have 
the chance. Thank you!",5
"This is a fun break from the more ""kid like"" games I usually play.... hahaha! Very enjoyable",5
"It's so amazing! It has a lot of Math-Olympiad style problems which helped 
me immensely!",5
"Great product. Couple of bugs though and some rough edges in UX and UI 
design.",4
"Very helpful app. , problems of the week are amazing sir i heartily thank u",5
Perfect app to use to entertain a bored mind. The questions are of high quality and description of answers are great.,5
"One of the best apps. I got premium and it worth it. There are some courses that are not available yet, looking forward to them.",5
I really enjoy this app. The way the content is presented improves the learning dynamics of the topics.,5
"Hard puzzles which will make your head scratch and think harder, although you will have to pay if you want to use all the services",4
"Very well made. Well thought out. And well worth the download. Excellent 
brain exercises!",5
This app is great but would make it even better if someone can read it for me. If that was a thing I would use this app a lot more.,4
"I think it is a brilliant app, only most of the things have to be paid. 
Other wise it will be 5 star and excellent!",4
"Good, but leaves knowledge gaps unfilled. Not a one-stop shop for learning a topic.",4
Mind bogglingly beautiful interface.. And so are the questions..👌,5
The new update is truly good but it needs more features to be introduced,5
A great app...Unfortunately You quickly come up against a pay wall.,1
"The idea is cool, but it is way too expensive for what it is. Why subscription insteat of purchase tho ?",2
"Amazing courses . I'm thirteen years old and I know almost everything any 
12th grade or even college student would know . Спасибо!",5
"I've barely used it, but I like what I'm doing so far. I started with the logic section and I'm still working on it.",4
Seems broken. Can't select a topic and lots of blank slides.,1
"Perfect for the busy student. Fill up your screen time with smart things 
rather than social media!",5
Very nice app! Teaches the concepts very nicely!,5
Finally someone understood the fact that you can only ever comprehend mathematics when you figure out the connections yourself and develop a global viewpoint.,5
"Great way to learn math. Its actually fun to solve problems which is the 
essence of math.",5
Strong content but you come up against a Pay wall quickly,4
Make tough subjects accessible but not an expert. Keeps subjects interesting and flows well.,5
Pls increase the number of free courses.What can we do by doing 3-4 free questions on a topic???,3
"Great app. Best problem solving app, I have ever use.",5
Lots of great free content. I wish the full content was more reasonably priced.,5
"A variety of subjects and problems ranging in complexity that give the 
brain a well needed workout. It's pretty dope.",5
Brain storming session Covers topics on a wide variety of subjects. Easy to use any where anytime.,5
Better than all the teachers I had together. Wo need school when you can have this app.,5
"I love it, except I wish we didn't have to pay to unlock more problems.",5
"Simply Brilliant, engages your brain power in so many ways.",5
If I can reactivate my account that's better since I have paid for it.,5
One of the best apps to jog one's brains without any commitment or need for continuation,5
Great for those who want to brush up on their mathematics skills and learn something new,5
"Very good, but would be awesome if there was some material about category theory",5
"I enjoy the little puzzles sent to my email,they're cute",5
"Awesome app for problem solving, and much more awesome stuff.",5
I have serious problems with maths in school and this app really helps me a lot and that's only one subject.,5
"Love it, wish I could buy the paid app!",5
Brilliant is the perfect app for learn and understand the world around us.,5
very informative but just enough to not overwhelm you.really like it,5
It's great.it makes learning things like velocity very easy.,5
"What more can I say, it's just simply BRILLIANT",5
Fun app if learning is your favourite pass time.,5
I've learned so much with this app and will keep learning stuff,5
Do free daily problem solving if you want to become smarter,5
"Really good app for learning new things, and maintaining old ones",5
"Great mind workout problems in a quick, easy to use app.",5
"Fun, insightful, challenging but expensive",4
"This App not only educational, it's fun!",5
It's d best app that I've ever came across,5

You should have to provide some more free containt,5
Oh holy hell! This app is the reason Why I am an introvert,5

"This is an engaging and enjoyable app. All the areas I've dont have been 
really informative and helpful. I've improved and I'm on my way to becoming 
one with the universe. 10/10 must see answers to life.",5
"I think this would be amazing, I would love to be all about it. But that 
subscription price is far too much! Especially when I can get netflix for a 
third of the price and get dumber.",4
"The only issue found was the text covering the operation selection with 
text in the section ""Is It Possible?"" Other than that, this application is 
absolutely magnificent!!!",5
"It's fun and engaging. And the puzzles are sometimes harder than u think 
and you can make silly mistakes. Be careful 🤓",5
"It is a very informative app. I learn more things everyday. Now, knowledge 
is just at the palm of my hand.",5
"Excellent app to understand science and mathematics in simpler,logical and 
understandable way which makes understanding and application of knowledge 
in the improvement of life skills...Also it's fun to give exercise to brain 
through this app,thank you develpers",5
Great learning tool. Worth the premium subscription in my opinion,5
very nice. helps a lot for learning math and science,5
"It's a great app for anybody wishing to learn and gain real knowledge. 
However courses may need to be paid for through the subscription service",5
"It's amazing how high-school level math and science are synthesized into 
problems challenging even to one educated up to the college level!",5
"What have you been doing with your time before Brilliant? Really. Just get 
it",5
Everything is perfect but too expensive.... not for everyone to use.,5
"I just wish it was more vocabulary friendly to people who does not have a 
big vocabulary if that make sense",5
"Even the free material in this alp helps to understand basic logic and 
science!",5
"Fantastic, very helpful for learning physics and Maths",5
This app help me a lot to become best programmer,5
Great app for hobbyists. Lovely design.,5
Awesome application for learning and remembering fundamental skills,5
I think it's the best educational app ever,5
This is the first app i rate because it is very beautiful app,5

Pretty good,5
This is good stuff,5
coool,5
Nice...,5
It make brain gud.,5
"Superb... Just love this app... Boosted my Analytical skills, especially in physics... 😊😊😊☺️ ☺️But just that pricing that sucks... 😔",5
"Great Idea, very good games, good app, average interface, bad price. 
Although this app is very useful and it is one of the best apps all time, 
it is yet very expensive and not for everyone to use. Only for people who 
has the money. It would be great if you had an alternative or at least 
charity or government support so it will be accessible for all people. 
Education for all not just for rich",4
"I have been using this for a while to refresh my mathematics skills. It was 
fine on simpler subjects, but as I got into more complex material I found 
the ""getting stumped is part of learning"" approach to be tedious and 
condescending. Don't waste my time, if you teach me I will learn, stow the 
reverse psychology, Mr. Miagi nonsense.",3
"I am loving Brilliant. I bought the year long subscription and they have 
awesome content on everything math, physics and computer science related, 
exactly what I needed. Real quality content and elaborate wiki's next to 
the quizzes of the topics.",5
"Couldn't be happier with the active and visual approach to learning. 
Questions are very thought provoking and cause you to mull over new 
concepts being introduced. You'll learn faster and deeper with this app!",5
"I expected this to just be an app displaying Wikipedia pages, but I'm 
amazed at the visual approach and lateral thinking concepts used in their 
approach to learning! It teaches you more than how things work, it teaches 
you how to think! Amazing",5
"Premium pricing strategy sucks. £70 now or £15 a month. That's 3 times more 
a month. Let me sign up for a month for cheap and then forget about the 
recurring payment for 3 years.",1
"It helped me build my grasp on concepts of many topic..... Specially 
physics and i think it also improved my logical reasoning...... Gerat app 
in general thanks! Love to see it offline someday....",4
"If you pay it is good. If you don't it's almost unusable. In my opinion if 
you have internet, you don't need briliant to learn all the material 
teached.",2
"I've learned a lot while letting this app show me how little I know! Easy 
to use, intuitive, and methodological in its teaching process, all are high 
points. The top prize, however, goes to the fact that you can sequence what 
you learn yourself, instead of a predetermined order. Excellent! 7.5 out of 
5!",5
"The problems offered by this app are creative and interesting to solve, as 
well as educating. I considered myself well-grounded in algebra, but the 
devs managed to find some areas where I had something to learn. The process 
was quite enjoyable. I recommend this app, including the paid subscription.",5
"Very informative and fun. It would be helpful if it was possible to 
highlight and search unfamiliar words through the app, however.",4
"Love the app. Hate the price. Not everyone earns in dollars but I guess 
that's our fault for being in a third world country.",2
"Best of what a learning platform can be. Brilliant not on introduce you to 
the wonderful world of math and science but also helps u excel in them.",5
"Opened the app, then instantly closed the app because it requires you to 
register or use a social media account. This should not be necessary, 0/10, 
definitely not recommended.",1
"It was fun solving problems until the becomes all about money You guys 
shouldn't take not money for only presentation and collection of some 
knowledge that you haven't made. But still it's fun solving the weekly 
challenges",1
"Fun and challenging problems every week. Also the 'Discuss Solutions' 
segment provides different approach to each problem. Best learning app ever!",5
"Great app 10/10 will buy premium. Love how fun it makes it to learn about 
hard science and math.",5
"Really helpful app. I like to use it to stay engaged in areas of maths and 
science that I am not directly working on in school and find even a very 
small amount of time spent using it will a day will help you improve with 
maths and science.",5
"Great app, easy to use. The interface allows one to quickly learn and 
unpack complicated subjects.",5
"I have learned and will learn so much from this! Thank you all for bringing 
such a masterpiece to existence!",5
"It's a useful app if you want to have fun solving problems something to do 
while waiting for your doctor, appointment, and all the mundane things we 
wait for. P.S this app made me solve a problem while on the John 😂",5
"This app is amazing. It gives you new problems every week with profound 
mathematical truths embedded within them, allowing you to discover these 
truths for yourself in the process of solving the problems.",5
"Get an education and not have a thirty thousand dollar student loan. Sounds 
pretty good to me",5
"Very helpful in learning math and science. Would recommend to everyone 
that's struggling or prospering",5
"Why do developers insist on flooding their users with annoying 
notifications? No one wants this.",1
"Enjoyable and educational.. a great combo. Schools could learn from this 
method!",5
"too good an app..... but too bad a price.... quite expensive compared to 
similar apps",4
"Brilliant helps keep me on my toes, and serves as a reminder to consider 
(read) the whole problem before rushing to answer.",5
Best interactive educational app ever. Congratulations to developers.,5
"this is great app..... very intutive and triggering curosity within...... 
really great...)))",5
"One of the best apps I've reviewed. I'm so happy that I can learn on the go 
!",5
It's great but it doesn't have much content to non-premium.,4
I love thinking and this app makes me think so win win. Good app,5
100% helpful especially to engineering students. Great work!,5
"There should be a Spanish version of this app, is one of best ways of 
learning and it could be cool if it were in more languages",5
"Constantly engaging problems although courses are sometimes not the easiest 
to navigate",4
Challenging! Just the way I like it. GREAT APP. HIGHLY RECOMMEND,5
"This is a wonderful company and a wonderful app! Finally, something that 
really does help me improve my mind!",5
"It's worth the money if you are looking to improve the way you approach 
thought.",5
"Until now, this app is fantastic, simple and with some great content.",5
"Very cool, but too expensive.",3
This is my go-to app for fun and informative math problems/practice.,5
Pretty dope way to brush up on some knowledge you may have lost over time.,5
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. (no puns intended),5
Helps with keeping the mind shape and having you wanting to do more.,5
Good app for learning and constructively filling your spare moments.,5
"La mejor herramienta para mantener la mente activa y en constante 
desarrollo de una manera divertida que te hará perder la noción del tiempo",5
Best app to get gpod at maths and physics.,5
"It is fantastic . Some are so difficult that i feel like an idiot 
sometimes😂 .",5
Really good for anyone wanting to learn stuff by himself,5
It sucks cause in discreet gave the wrong answers,1
Just makes me think beyond my capacity.,5
It is an brilliamt app. It teaches very smoothly and in a calm way,5
THE premier brain expanding app on the Play Store.,5
Everyone should download it. Definitely a must have.,5
Great app. Very useful and fun.,5
Simply brilliant (apologies for the pun :),5
It helps me to think. It's like a challenge! Like it,5
This is a great experience for people who have a great thirst for knowledge,5
a beautiful idea for spending some free time,5
Helpful and makes u think like a scientist,5
"Really good app, with detailed teachings",5

"The app is great.Perhaps it would also be beneficial to have a provision 
for offline downloads",4
"The app stopped opening on Nokia 8 after the latest update . Can you plz 
help",4
"Having the ability to learn and try new ideas in the palm of your hands is 
powerful.",5
"I like app really much however there is only one flaw that I noticed. When 
you're not able to reach the required correct points to finish a quiz, you 
would have to retry the same quiz. The suggestion that I can give is when 
retrying the quiz, give other examples with the same concept in order for 
the understanding of the user to be tested and to help reduce a sort of 
""unproductive"" answering of the quiz.",4
"Haven't used the app yet as it has a glitch. Attempted to create an account 
with my Google account and on the next screen it has the heading Birthday 
and under it is red text that reads 'this field is required' and that's it. 
No way to add the information. So that will need a fix before I can use the 
app.",3
"Very amazing app to get a jump on studies in a great variety of sudy 
material.. Plus it's free if you want the full effects of the material you 
pay a little but at least you won't have to pay for student loans like a 
dummy if you do it this way.",5
"Loving it! It is what i was hunting from so many days.I wanted to learn 
things more practically and thing what it does.I hate school's passive 
studies and this gave me a new hope in my learning process.",5
"I would like a ""save for offline use"" option on the problem sets. There 
seems to be a feature like this (since there is a ""saved sets"" category in 
the menu), but I can't find how to actually save a set.",5
"Amazing app, helps inspire and grow interest in a variety of disciplines. 
Starts simple and finished intense for each subject, which is absolutely 
perfect. Love it.",5
"Excellent app! Easy to use and very informative. Highly recommend this app 
for anybody curious on learning new concepts.",5
"I had to edit my review, from a fantastic 5 ⭐'s down to a couple 🌟's. The 
app is really cool, enjoyable, entertaining, all of that. I would give 10 
stars in all of those areas, BUT (yes, a big ol' but)this grand app is a 
rope-a-dope, in The true definition of the term (which, btw, is basically 
""bait and switch, a set up, it's not as perfect as it seems) u see, I was 
really enjoying this app, when suddenly I was cut off, and read that if i 
wanted to continue enjoying this app, I have to ""buy the full version."" 
Argh! As heartless as a drug dealer, giving me a taste of something i will 
no doubt enjoy, but told that's all i can have, unless I'm willing to pay."" 
Gotta pay to play..."" BOO.",5
"A great app if you want to work out your brain or learn new concepts. I 
highly recommend this app.",5
"Really awesome app. They did a great work getting all the awesome content 
from their website into mobile form.",5
"I love this app. This app has everything you need. I have learned much 
things throughout those courses!",5
"It is helpfull to recall my subjects in high school life and interesting to 
learned",4
"Very interesting. A great way to pass time without subjecting your mind to 
YouTube.",5
I feel smarterer every day. Thanks,5
"This is very good app for students who love logical thinking and this is 
great app for me. It is an incredible brain exerciser.",5
I think it's a great idea. It keeps me not only busy but also challenged,5
"God will bless the makers of BRILLIANT for the quality education they are 
providing to us ... Thanks thanks a lot!!!",5
"I like this app because its give mr alot of common sense about the world da 
we no.",5
The best place to disclose your knowledge and to explore amazing things.,5
"This is the most useful app for ones who want to practice fundamental 
science disciplines.",5
Amazing app I can't even describe it's brilliance...,5
needs ability to download courses for offline use,4
"It sure makes me feel happy, its cool",5
Amazing app that keeps getting better. The future is here.,5
Does what it says. Simple and easy to understand.,5
Someone else has my account already.... this is Gary.....,1
It's really useful as long as you use it,5
Great but the premiums pricing is high!,5
It is generally a good app to have,4
Nice approach!,5
Bst app for science ..love it,5
Brilliant has brilliant questions...,5
Useful for learning beyond school.,5
Great app always helps in studies,5
Great way to learn and cultivate curiosity,5
So good for exercising the neural connections,5
Absolutely worth it!,5
Such a good app,5
Fun & Easy,5
"Well, as the name suggests... 🤩",5
In love with this,5
This app is super dope.,5
Luks gud,5
"The controls are not at all convenient, as the view tries to decide every 
moment if I'm swiping to move the slider or to got to the next card. This 
makes it ultra laggy and unpleasant to use. Also, the UI is not to good 
overall.",3
I hope I can enjoy a Brilliant free-apps. And I can learning Math,5
"Its a great app but you have to pay to understand the problem.... Not a 
good app for learning unless you want to pay",3
"I am 12 years old and rhe problems are too hard for me so I am uninstalling 
it .",1
Absolutely amazing. Helps alot with Special Relativity and Quantum objects!,5
Great app for training your mathematical and analytical brain muscle. :D,5
"I love this app, hope will get meaningful things by doing Brilliant every 
day.",5
"Great content, the app could be a bit better",4
Too expensive that's why I haven't paid 4 it,4
This app is just good for people who have money,1
This is good app for all related knowledge of professional.,5
Great for learning. A really solid app.,5
To acquire and improve more knowldge it is very useful,5
Amazing app for improving math thinking skills,5
'Brilliant' as the name itself suggests.,5
So far it is good. Cheers.,5
Loooove it,5
"Great app to learn on the go. It is very useful to brush up topics while 
gaining a good understanding of the concepts. One feature I would like to 
see added is the ability to favorite topics so I can go to it directly 
without having to navigate to it from scratch every time.",5
"This app is very hard to use on a 5"" mobile device. The slider controls 
don't lock the movement on horizontal axis and the screen scrolls, 
overlapping of labels interfere with slider movement. This mobile app is 
very irritating and hard to use.",2
"Fantastic app and concept! I wish I had this app during my undergrad in 
Mech Eng. Regardless, will still be using to brush up and keep learning:)",5
"I downloaded brilliant today and tried to pay for the premium. However 
neither my credit card nor my netbanking option is being accepted.",2
"Awesome app, I wish I could trade some subscription benefits for watching 
ads instead of having to pay but it's still great.",5
"Premium is to expensive Unless they can justify why it costs that much I'm 
uninstalling.",2
I wish I could get a topic completely for free {just 1},4
It's very good!!! I spend a lot of time in it than I expected.,5
"Great app, helps me make a visit to ITA.",5
"It's a good way to kill some time while making yourself smarter little by 
little",5

A nice way to learn...,5
I wish the one month fee should be a little bit lower,5
Concept is amazing,5
Amo las matemáticas.,5
SCIENCE!!!!!!,5
"The desktop version is still better e.g. because it allows one to edit and 
create wikis, notes and problems. Disappointing to see that you haven't yet 
integrated the potential core features that could attract more app users. 
Looking forward to having these features I asked for months ago in the next 
update.",3
"A useless app worth 1 star. Useless because they don't teach anything, it's 
just a bunch of (hard) questions, no background teaching or explanation. 
Only when you answer to the question you get the solution, which at that 
point is quite useless. That's not how you learn, first you need the mental 
tools to solve the problems and only then you should be quizzed with real 
problems to put in practice what we've learned. Programmers go home, you 
are drunk",1
"I wish I had a better understanding of mathmatical phrasing to understand 
to questions. Half the time I get easy problems wrong because of my limited 
education and understanding of math geammer. Is there a brilliant corse for 
that?",4
"Best app if you want to learn something conceptually. When the concept gets 
fixed in your brain, no amount of time can erase it. That's how good this 
app is. Do buy if you have the money. Worth it..",5
"This app is an excellent tool for building knowledge and skill in 
mathematics. It engages users in interactive problems and provides a wide 
range of mathematical topics to learn about with clear and concise, 
easy-to-follow explanations that can help make math more intuitive and fun 
to learn.",5
"I like the content provided and the lessons given. I do wish there was more 
lesson content and more discussions though. Overall its a pretty 
informative app for learning.",4
"Best app for brain training.... Don't go for Lumosity and Elevate just 
because of their popularity and end up paying huge amounts... This app is 
the best and we can play according to our choice instead of their levels.",5
"This app is Brilliant!! (Excuse the pun) Seriously, though, I really need 
help in understanding complex concepts a lot!",5
"Best app I ever download. It's simply brilliant. It gives u an opportunity 
to understand the basics of maths and science using logical reasoning. 5 
star quality.",5
"Actually this is a good application to improve your problem solving skill 
and learn science. But some of the lesson contain typo and it kind of get 
me irritated",3
"Great app with easy to learn concepts. Enjoyed using it,. Just wish the 
free version was longer.",5
"It's good if you want to increase your thinking capacity. It's just not fun 
to do using this app.",2
"The sheer quantity of questions and learning content is insane. Highly 
recommended.",5
"I love the introductions. I wish I could go further, but sadly the 
subscription is too expensive for me.",2
"It won't let me login it says it can't complete the registration at this 
time and it's been doing that for days",1
"It can be way better by providing the info it self then a test at the end 
of the chapter persay",1
"Great app but wish it gave some more questions before it requires you to 
buy premium",4
"Just finished with my JEE ADVANCED. This app helps me use my time 
productively at the same time helps develop problem solving skills",5
"I wished this app was free and require no monthy registration so people can 
enjoy knowledge 😢",4
"Nice app but pretty limited if youre not premium. The weekly brain teaser 
are really challenging and fun.",5
"Love the challenges, the push you to think outside the box, and consider 
all options rather than the most obvious.",5
"Great for learning and occasional brain teasers. Haven't paid yet, but 
considering it, for sure.",5
"Great for people wanting to learn, can be confusing at times though.",4
"Brilliant *wink*, My brain was a dry raisin before this app, its well worth 
the price",5
"I would definitely reccomend getting premium, makes learning math quite 
enjoyable!",5
"So far it is the best application that I found to practice math, logic, 
chemistry and even machine learning!",5
the app need to explain some how the answer ....make us smart ..too,5
Good to review stuff i have learned in university.,4
"I highly recommend this app if you want to goof around something that 
actually strengthens your brains and reasoning skills",5
"This is the best app I have ever found.All mathematics and science lovers 
should get it.",5
"I love desktop version much interesting.But the app is awesome to do 
problems too",5
Fantastic learning application ; my brain hurts!,5
excellent app... must download for every student,5
Great for keeping your mind working.,5
It is a very interesting fun/learning app,5
"This is insanely cool, tool.",5
This app is very productive.,5
Great app for us to practice,5
Great app for educating yourself,5
Brilliant and fun.,5
A brilliant App😁,5
Enjoying learning science,5

A bit too pricey for students,5
Amazing....,5
Good...,5
I learnt so much!!!,5
How to Save data For Offline,3
It worked to amaze me!,5
"Love it, makes me think in ways I would normally not and learn from it.",5
Really helpful for learning university content at a good price,5
It's simply brilliant!!,5
Awesome brainstorming maths,5
Best app to learn.....,5
Very clean !!!,4
"Hi Brilliant, this game is brilliant! It's so easy to use and the 
challenges are difficult to solve (witch is good) 😉. But i have 1 
problem... i come from belgium and i only can speak and understand a little 
english. If you can add multiple languages, that will be amazing. Top app!! 
Defenitly reccoment this to other poeple that want to take up a challenge!",5
"This is a fantastic app and subscription service that helps people of all 
ages learn or refresh concepts in math, physics and other disciplines. I am 
a physicist and I am always trying to brush up on concepts that are not in 
my specialty, especially in Math. I love the way they teach you basic 
concepts and I like that I can keep learning even when I'm on the move. 
Simply brilliant!",5
"I dip in and out of this app infrequently - a couple times a month at most 
- and that's fine. Brilliant always has interesting logic to think about 
and learn from. I can't ever recall seeing ads in it, and - best of all - 
it doesn't nag me to use it when I don't want to. 5 stars.",5
"Best online math and science resource. This app is filled with great 
explanations of difficult subjects, problems that require not only 
knowledge but creativity, and amazing people that can definitely help when 
you do not fully grasp a concept. Brilliant!",5
"I've always heard about brilliant and I'm glad I finally decided to try it. 
Even the free version offers so much great content and lessons. They have 
topics I enjoy and it helps break down complex problems into bite-sized 
pieces. Excellent app!",5
"Quizler çok iyi herkes kullanmalı çözmeye çalışmalı bence - free quizzes 
are seems like a little bit less than it should be. I know that the you 
can't make it better without money but you should do the educational videos 
more for free, anyway it's pretty good app for problem solving",5
"I'm very sceptical about this kind of apps, but this one is very different. 
I see that all tasks are designed by deep understanding of problem. Thank 
you for this brilliant!",5
"I wish I had discovered this app sooner! Really detailed explanations and 
clearly, very well thought out questions and answers. I hope I can support 
the developers one day with a monthly or yearly subscription.",5
"Truly Brilliant!! That's the most fascinating app I have found on the 
store. I would say that it's a must download app for any student & 
professionals. The best thing is that it doesn't contain ads ..",5
"Brilliant is simply ""Brilliant"" 😁 I like the puzzles, especially those 
dealing with logic and math.... I only wish that some of the quizzes 
offered were free but anyways 😊 Thanks a lot guys 😉 God bless",5
"Very well thought and executed app with great content from what I can see 
but the cost is a problem. The all or nothing strategy is not compatible 
with the absence of guaranteed results.",4
"Not being able to get a refund is a huge negative for me. I purchased the 
one year deal then changed my mind on it. All I can do is cancel the 
automatic purchase next year. I want a refund.",2
"Good concept, bad execution. Feels very condescending while being unclear 
in the questions.",2
"Who'd have thought that, at age 43 I'd be taking multiple choice science 
and math tests... for fun.",4
"Good learning tool, but the app uses insulting language like ""clever"" and 
""naive"".",4
"Brilliant is far better than any other learning websites, oh please! Khan 
Academy is like brilliant's brother so dont compare them.",5
"I'm a college student and brilliant helps me stay on my toes and keep up 
with relevant challenging problems in all disciplines that concern me. The 
community is , well brilliant and the learning experience is something well 
worth your time.",5
"Brilliant app and concept as a whole for life long learning. Woke up the 
student in me.",5
Great app!! I love the app concept about learning! Keep developing it!!,5
"Effective learning method utilising Catechism, Curiosity, and Challenge.. 
Brilliant! 😄",5
"Sorry. I don't agree with forced login policy. I'll take ads, but not that.",2
"Too expensive, try decreasing subscription fee and I'm sure everyone will 
like to use it.",2
"The app is very good but please come up with new chapters that are yet not 
present but were promised to be there",4
"It just makes you do things, but it doesn't teach you how to do these 
things.",2
"Very comprehensive, simple to use and versatile as a method of learning. 
Like a Duolingo of stem.",5
"it's amazing as it is, though I would be glad to be able to use it offline. 
at least to some degree",5
"Great service. It does cost money for the full stuff, but it was worth the 
yearly subscription for me.",5
"Great app for learning Science and Maths.. Great app for engineers to test 
the brain",5
"I love this app,its awesome to keep my mind sharp ^^",5
Fantastic for figuring some different level content on multiple subjects.,5
It's a good app for building problem solving skills.,5
Great stuff if this is what floats your boat...,5
"Life noggin sent me to this app and they don't play about finding out apps 
to challenge you",5
Excellent app to test your brain with really good problems.,5
Great app for students or just curious people who want to learn,5
hm a little more cheaper and i wouldve subscribed,4
Awesome I am improving my IQ because of Brilliant,5
Super cool app if you like maths,5
Very nice way to understand complex scientific principles,5
Really good and has some very creative questions,5
Excellent app. Very nice design and slick.,5
Awesome application. Must have item.,5
Great work.....concepts are crystal clear,5
"This is good, but expansive.",4
"Amazing app, great learning experience",5
"Clear, Well built, Extremely Useful",5
Brilliant way to keep mind active.,5
The app is one of the best for mobile phone addicts,5
Nice app for learning concepts and problem solving,5
Pretty good even without the subscription.,5

Amazing !,5
Does exactly what it says it does,5
Absolutely awesome,5
Just awesome,5
My thoughts speak beyond words,5
It Is BRILLIANT,5
It's costly though,5
Failure is Not an option,5
Just an eggcellent app. 😜,5
costly,1
Very intellectual,4
Eh,5
Yeet,5
Thanks,5
noice app,5
"It provides an interesting and diffrent point of view on various physical 
phenomena and mathematical concepts. Great app , worth the yearly 
subscription.",5
Not giving 5 star because it's too costly.,3
"A very good step towards a better learning. It really helps you develop a 
different thinking.",5
"Excellent app.Helps to build the habit of problem solving and enhance 
logical thinking ability.",5
Getting smarter everyday.,5
"Don't waste your time and DEFINITELY don't waste your money on this app. No 
educational value, merely a tablet/phone equivalent to the crosswords and 
chess games in newspapers--in other words a way for moderately intelligent 
people with spare time to feel smarter than they really are. Waste of drive 
space... IMHO.",2
"Great way to kill time or simply to sharpen up your math skills. Great 
mental work out so get the app.",5
"Is anyone else facing problems loading interactive graphs in graphing and 
modelling? I was in the transformations section but the interactive graph 
never loaded. Please fix this.",5
"This app is great in teaching a variety of subjects in an easy to follow, 
interactive way! Love it!",5
"I would enjoy more practical skills,but the app is great !",4
"imagine if you spent your subscription money on this instead of streaming 
services, maybe the whole world would be just as brilliant",5
"Brilliant app is helping a lot students who r interested to learn physics n 
maths both in deep.....thanku....",5
very cool app! Always new things everyday!,5
"Brilliant is always a brilliant choice by using which subjects become 
passion, learning becomes a hobby and you become a genius!",5
Up till now my experience is good with this app,5
Awesome you'll learn and have fun,5
It seems fun not sure how practical,4
Amazing app. Perfect brain teaser app.,5
Amazing app for learning in a playful manner!!!,5
Awesome app to practise maths :),5
Intriguing content!,5
Just marvellous.,5
Love it !,5
Great concepts,5
"The app is wonderfull, well designed, really great to use and colorfull. 
The fact is that unless you pay ≈ 6 £ month (for a year) or ≈ 20 £ month 
(for a single month) you can access only 5 % of the app. And not even 
usefull because you can't get the solutions of the questions, meaning that 
you can't even learn what you've done wrong. I'm really really disapointed 
because this app seems truly complete. I would definitely pay if it was way 
more cheaper. Really disapointed :(",2
"Great idea. The cost is a bit much, given Khan Academy is free, but it does 
motivate you and is still fun even if you don't pay for premium. 5 stars if 
people can earn premium for contributing and the wiki pages for fundamental 
topics could be more clear and helpful. I couldn't apply what I got from 
the page on inertia to the problem I set out to solve. Also, feature 
request: Add computational help, the likes of symbolab.",4
"The UI is horrible. Within 2 seconds the app is already asking me to pay. 
It give me a long list of courses. I chose one and then it takes me to a 
payment page. Backing out of this page pits me against a confusing list of 
menus. I finally got back to the original list of courses and it was in a 
different order. The first one I clicked on took me to another payment 
page. I have no clue what this app is about. Horrible horrible first 
experience. I will search for something else.",1
"I like this app. It's way more fun to me than Sudoku or a crossword puzzle 
or something. I just wish if you found a challenge you enjoyed, you could 
select an option to do ""more like this"". I really enjoy moderate geometry 
puzzles... Simply finding angles using geometry concepts and rules. The 
most basic would be like complementary and supplementary angles. Picture 
that but with a dozen lines, a circle with a cord bisecting it, a 
tangential line... I like working from one angle to the next to figure out 
the measurement of an angle way on the other side of the construct. I just 
did a problem like that, and the next one was a new concept, when I wanted 
more like the problem I just solved. Just a suggestion, but overall I love 
this app.",5
A decent app but there are enough similar apps out there that the monthly fee for unlocking all the content doesnt seem justified at all. Especially for a casual player like myself. I might consider a one time purchase but until then...,2
"The Brilliant product as a whole is very effective. It makes learning fun with the use of clever puzzles. This very user-friendly app allows me to learn on the go.  If you want to improve your math or science skill, get a subscription for Brilliant. I promise it will be well worth the price.",5
"I left school over a decade ago and have been working in a job that isn't 
intellectually stimulating. Brilliant seemed like a good way to stimulate 
my brain and potentially re-educate myself in maths and science so I might 
have the option of a career change. After using Brilliant for just over a 
week, I can tell you it has taught me some tricks that were eye opening and 
that I wish I had learnt in school. However I have a bit of an issue that I 
am seemingly forced to learn in imperial measurements. Also I wish there 
were ways to do maths drills as I felt in school this is how problem 
solving skills stayed in my brain.",3
"I've been bouncing through apps to find the best that can sharpen my math, 
physics and C.S. skills on my free time that is also not boring , and I've 
found it. By far the best sciencey app out there with great paid perks and 
courses in all topics at a pretty good level. 5 stars and my support to the 
team so the curriculum can keep building up!",5
"The app in itself is quite good, but it's never worth 20 €/month, sorry. 
The saddest part in this is that most of this money is probably not even 
going to the developers who spent time finding interesting riddles, but 
spent to buy annoying ads on YouTube.",1
This is definitely helping me jump back into the world of being a life long learner. I had been a bit lazy with my individual study but the app chooses entertaining and increasingly difficult puzzles to get the brain working again.,4
"Great content, but it becomes hard to retain what you learn and it doesn't quite teach you how to do everything on its own.  I would recommend premium if you want something to keep you sharp and learn new cool concepts.",4
"Stimulating, without being obtrusive of my time. This is the type of brain 
game I had been looking for for years. Now I've found it. Challenging, well 
presented, clear and concise puzzles. No tricks, either you get it or you 
do not.",5
"This is really great app. but in some cases the question is asked before 
the topic is discussed* and some explanation are not in so easy to 
understand. *( I'm wrong maybe)",5
It is amazing in the sense of combining combining both learning application at once...I am a 9th grade student who enjoys physics alot and this app just expanded my knowledge and understanding exponentially... Thank you very much I enjoy it alot.,5
"This app is helping me get back on track with math and computer science. It 
presents everything in the right order, and even when I don't understand, 
it gives an explanation of why I got the problem wrong",5
"I haven't really use the app that often but I'm willing to learn even more 
about our world that we live in today. thanks to those who worked on this 
app and hopefully you can make other features learning about evolution or 
biology",5
Brilliant! Finally someone has offered fun interactive learning with a thoughtfully executed design and platform. Built with the end user in mind. Built with care.,5
this is an extraordinary app  i came here through pbs space time  but the thing is it needs some work such as.       its interface is slow and very old styled......its wiki pages loads very slow ........its statistical data is not so good to watch   and their should be a level of ques that we can select ......how hard or easy  😍😍😍☺☺,5
"Very nice but a bit expensive ah. I love the logic puzzles but can't access 
any of the paid ones maybe give us one puzzle per month of app use?",4
"Could be full paid version. The premium version could offer videos; walk 
throughs and case studies with more advanced questions.",4
"It is very good but you should have finished high school to do all the subjects without being stuck. Else you will find that the lessons do logical jumps, skipping knowledge needed to understand them.",5
"Great app , developer and good for exercising , very helpful but for 
purchasing the quizzes that would be a problem because there are blenty of 
them , plus there is many apps out there has no fee on thier quizzes",4
Interesting concept and problems here with good explorations. Although steep monthly price tag to the average person.,4
"This is a fantastic application for learners of any age group. Although at the beginning I found it difficult to browse through the categories, I could say it's better than the actual website.",5
"Just me on my toes, but also knocks me down a few notches too. Thanks",5
"Really liked the app, and impressed by the content created by the devs, 
brilliant idea and brilliant development of it... Thanks!",5
Definitely works my brain and I really enjoy that. Super good verity too.,5
Full of Brain teaser type Questions! Good to train the mind sharper.,5
"I think its great use!!! If you know me, then you know the whole story!!",5
"Goid App. But make it free. As knowledge always has to be freely available. 
Everyone deserves full version of this app. Cheers. :)",5
This has to be the best app created ever. Learning has never been more effective than this. Highly recommended,5
Loving this app. So much to explore and learn. Guess I'm a geek!,5
One of the intro puzzles has a wrong answer lol. Unreal.,1
This app deserves of 5 rating... Thanks a lot developers and designers...,5
"Why make me register ? maybe i don't want or need to register... to bad 
wolud love to give it a try.",1
"This app only quizzes you, not teach. It's useless and you should avoid it",1
"This doesn't teach, just asks if you can already solve the problem.",2
"Can't get passed the intro, it goes back to start after clicking continue",1
"Has a plethora of fantastic problems on a large number of topics. One of 
the most useful and diverse educational apps out there.",5
So many different parts of maths computer including advance level that is really good and the explaination of the problems and their solution is really make it easy to learn .,5
"An amazing place to learn, fun and easy! It will test what you think you know.",5
"It should warn you that you need an account and that your info is most 
probably sold.",2
"Great concepts, great questions, great UI, great app!",5
"I love testing myself and training my mind. I just wish the app wasn't so 
dang expensive.",5
"Excellent app for mathematics. Even if you don't subscribe you can do 
problems weekly.",5
"A really interesting app. I really enjoy knowledge and learning so i 
actually consider unlocking the full thing.Well made",5
Awesome for solving mathematics. They have interesting set of problems in the collection.,5
"Needs to set better borders on the courses, because I often get lost and confused.",4
"Love the app.. Good to challenge the mind with problem solving in different 
tyoe of fields",5
This app is amazing. Purely awesome. Just... Brilliant.,5
Thanks so much Brillant team for this incredible work your doing by offering to a large public the keys to science knowledge. Thanks x1000,5
The best app For tough math questions.,5
👍TRULY this is a very good app for build a creative mind.the task given in this app are very appropriate. I LIKE THIS APP.👌,5
It's a great educational and mind-expanding app with puzzles that are relevant in the real world and that are always different covering many fields of knowledge,5
"Brilliant is not trying to dump a bunch of information and make you 
memorize it, rather it helps you develop intuition about subjects you're 
learning.",5
"I like the morning puzzles, they are incredible to start the day and stop being sleepy as you wake up!",5
"Brilliant is: Blindingly Bright... Even if Mathematics weren't one's 
strongsuit...",5
"What an awesome application !! It really helps me to more understand about 
computer science, thanks",5
This app is brilliant I believe I can change my star's love it thank you.,5
"It is the best app for me to improve my maths , thank you ^_^ :)",5
"Awesome, I'm learning new concepts at a pretty fast speed",5
"I enjoy getting on daily and learning about current, relative subjects.",5
"Its a great app, for those who get extreamly board during the day!!!",5
"It is one of the best app for all the conceptual things you need to know of 
your syllabus as well as for competition.",5

This app is grate,5
Make it free,5
(y),5
"Lovely. The way they present topics, with references to everyday scenarios, real life events and news, makes it even more fun and interesting. I don't like the subscription model though and I don't think it suits this app at all. Maybe with way more robust features, exercise framework, videos, teachers and a thriving community we can start talking about it. But, really, ads in the free version and a small (≤ 10€) one-time purchase to unlock all content is more appropriate. Especially considering you can learn all this from Wikipedia for free, albeit in a less approachable and easily digestible way (the main strength of this app).",5
Best App I have come across so far. The way it interact with the reader is just mind blowing. We could learn maths and phsyics without taking stress and without being exhausted. I love it! Thank you developer's ❤,5
"the sample problems are challenging,  but if you don't get the correct answer the first time. there is zero ability to learn.   also the $6 monthly charge is steep.",3
"I think there needs to be a bit more logic behind the proofs. For examples, you should explore the definition of integrals. This is far better then most other sources online. Maybe with some videos in the wiki sections.",5
Great 👍 App !! Thanks for the developer. I can find a lot of theory that didn't teached at school. And this app is very useful for student who want to study for math olympiad.,5
"excellent concept, and an ideal way of problem proposing that is both interesting and challenging in the same time. The multiple disciples could get a little too  confusing sometimes  and somewhat complicated.",4
"You people have made everything paid, man I cannot afford this much hope you make free, questions are interesting but I also want to know answers, cannot stay only with questions 🤔",4
If I could sign up for a year and pay monthly I would. Sadly I can't and don't want want to pay the huge price hike for a single month. Great app though.,4
I love the weekly problems and they help me to learn a lot. I really like this new kind of approach of learning through questioning. Just hope they make it free someday !,4
"Very well done and a great way to learn (judging from the free trials), but the subscription seems rather expensive. Don't know if thats unrealistic, but wouldn't exponentially more people consider serious purchase at half the price (especially students)?",4
"I'm realing loving this app, it made an inseparable connection between the math an me. There are no adjectives that can describe it!",5
"I wish I had some one teach me in school to think by intuition, instead of me memorizing countless formulas. I appreciate this companies mission and efforts in empowering adults to learn. Excellent app, beautifully laid out, engaged community.",5
This app is very good as all know it has very good concepts. And also please add  minimum time show feature to solve the problem by the problem by brilliant student.,5
"Had an issue with images not showing up properly, but thanks to the developer who responded to my feedback, the issue has been resolved",5
"The free trials seem good...but there're only short, and the whole subscription thing seems quite expensive, so I wouldn't bother with the app unless you're willing to pay.",3
"Amazing. I graduated with a pure Math degree 3 years ago, and I occasionally worry that (between life and teaching 9th graders) I would never use my Abstract Math skills again. Now I get a chance to flex my math muscles a little more!",5
"Absolutely love the puzzles, especially once solved. Very easy to use and works nicely.",5
Just download it and steal every concept from the app... One of the best sources of learning for me!!!,5
I really hope you will keep releasing more courses with the same level of quality. Thank you!,5
A famous line says: Train insain or remains the same. I guess the app serves the purpose. Love the module that trains my brain.,5
Since English is not my first Language it's kinda difficult to understand questions fully,2
I realize I'm not as smart as I think I am... 😳 thanks for the edification,5
Brilliant is made for everyone to become brilliant to know that what you have known and what to be know about math.... Loved it,5
Awesome questions.. But you have to think about some lazy people who doesn't like to read the questions😅😅. You should give them questions in audio...,5
Brilliant is nothing but absolutely brilliant. It's a great app for the beginners. Highly recommended!,5
"Fun little brain teasers, I don't do the paid part, but the free ones are engaging enough to get my brain going, make me feel like I'm learning like I did in school, only a lot better",5
"Wonderful app to keep oneself sharp and observant.Helps me brush up on a lot of fundamental concepts and also helps teach new concepts in a fun and entertaining way.Overall their app is fantastic, even if you choose not to pay for the premium version.Though I recommend getting one to get full benifit of the app.",5
I absolutely love it. It has been teaching me a lot of math,5
It's a bit rough around the edges but fun to use. I'm looking forward to see how they'll improve it.,4
Please add the ability to bookmark questions for later reference...,4
"Love this app. It's like a second teacher to me. The people who made this are just ""Brilliant""😂👍",5
Best app to learn new things it would be so good if I can unlock all the stuff free but it is slight greedy feeling as even without purchasing total course you would still be able to get a very good idea of concepts taught in a specific course,5
Extraordinary app and well worth the subscription ALTHOUGH the price is way too step. But can you put a price on knowledge?,4
"Not fully mobile integration, cannot rotate screen, confusing course selection and unethical rate-the-app policy",3
Free eduction in math and science. It's nice,5
I love your app.  I'm not in school because I can't afford it yet but your apps  keeps me from failing behind .,5
"Name one bad thing about brilliant... I'm waiting... Exactly, you can't.",5
Love it! Just wish there wasn't any premium version and it was all free with ads or something.,4
Brilliant is a really amazing app...it helps me ease my boredom while on holiday...I recommend (ps. Stan kpop),5
Great app for learning and challenging however they should create more activites for younger grade level students,4
"This is one of the best application that I ever used. If you would like to level up in your knowledge, use this app.",5
"This app really helpful, challenging, and very easy to use in entertaining ways... Very good to review subject from college time..",5
Challenges any assumption of knowledge on topics you may have. Fun learning experience.,5
"Awesome app, just need to have less charges, so that everyone can afford your application",4
Really good idea but having to pay for certain parts in the app takes away the feeling of learning,4
"I am learning great stuff, but there is so much that is restricted but costs a lot to unlock.",4
"This is an excellent way to keep your mind sharp. Unfortunately, the subscription is just too expensive for an app.",5
"Great selection of challenges and problems, great learning tool",5
It's great and challenging. But it would've been better if everything was free,5
"It's in the name, the app is brilliant. It's very good for someone who's genuinely looking to get good at the given topics.",5
"Great puzzles in broad fields of knowledge. A productive way to spend your 
leisure time...",5
IT IS A VERY USEFUL APP FOR EVERY STUDENT  AND IT CONTAIN ALL TYPE OF QUESTION,4
A simple and easy way to progressively learn more and more how things work in the world. Simply Brilliant.,5
"Creative learning app. But if the paid version was priced less, then it could be affordable.",5
"I don't know how I'm learning when you don't teach, just quiz.",2
I think this application is very useful and so fun. It is a good choice to learn science in a simple way.,5
Can not get past the question at the beginning that askes what one is most like you?,2
Keeps the mind active. I feel like a school boy again!,5
"Honestly amazing. If you can commit a few minutes every day, it'll actually 
make you smarter.",5

"Very interesting, makes you think outside the box!",5
It's amazing to learn almost any topic you want!,5
I can say that it is a great way to improve your math and science...,5
Interesting and educational. Only request is more material in the free version.,5

"I highly appreciate the structure of the lessons that truly provide 
connections between math and the real-world. There are many fine examples 
of how founding math instruction based on real-world examples, provides the 
learner with a solid foundation to understand and retain these concepts! An 
award would be merited to the responsible parties! Thid is literally the 
way math should be taught! However, on a much smaller scale I found some 
assuptions used in some lessons, to be unacceptable completely. An ""ideal"" 
trait might be most desirable but discounting the legitimacy of variable 
that exists in our world, creates a conflict of interest. Stereotypes are 
ignorant. Sorry.. still stellar but that flaw irks my little weirdo soul! 
Love thy neighbor today❤",3
"Paywall sucks. Option to click a math term when it's casually thrown at you for an explanation is needed, especially with english not being the language I learned math in. I need a refresher and to be able to check what it is in case I don't know it in english. It's real easy to forget when you haven't studied math for years.   Also needs more guidance on the first problem of a new subject, getting the first one wrong often is very discouraging, especially when it's because of lacking explanation.",2
"Absolutely amazing!  I'm 25 and bored. This provides simple, easy to understand step-by-step explanations for essentially how the world works. Ten stars to whoever wrote the explanations! Only thing I would suggest is maybe linking Wikipedia articles for even more depth to some topics. This app makes learning accessible to everyone, wish some of my teachers in high school used this instead of their lesson plans!",5
"This app is soooooo helpful! I've been in Pre-AP math classes for awhile and I was absent a lot but this app saved me. I could still study at my home when I'm sick so i won't be behind. I suggest this app to anyone who needs any help with math, especially if they need to catch up on their work!!! I'm planning on being an Electrical Engineer and I need to learn higher algebra for that class and this helps so much!!!  If want to go into a higher math class or do a college course involving hard and complicated math pleeeeaaaaase use this app. It is so worth it and will make you smarter in the end.  Perfect math learning app!!!",5
"There was an unsolvable solution that I claimed was red... There was not enough scientific data to determine the color of hat the man was wearing.. It was a 33 percent guess between 3 answers, one being unsolvable with submitted data.",1
"The problems can be fun and relatable; and there are a lot of different categories of problems. Also, when I get one wrong the explained solutions combined with other user commentary gives a strong understanding of how to find the solution... simply ""Brilliant""",5
"Expensive pay wall blocking most games, and it changed my rating in app to 4 stars from 3. Pressing 4 bumped it to 5 and auto continued. That's sneaky and not nice.",2
Fantastic! The problems are a great way to engage with the material and gain a deeper understanding. It's an intuitive way to learn and retain concepts that can be applied in many situations. MUCH better than the rote memorization that most of us experienced in school.,5
Best app i've ever donwloaded. You have free access to a wide range of topics (math/science) explained in a very good way. It also includes questionnaires in which you can test what you've learned.,5
"Certainly, all the courses interrelate, it's math. But there are too many external references in every course, with no organized connection I can find to create an efficient study plan.",3
"Direct, and very interactive. I like the elaborate and rich on point topics. They are deeper yet well written. The simplicity in delivery of  Math, and Computer Science makes it a pleasing exercise.",5
List of questions and good explanation to train your thinking skill in several different fields. A suggestion: Can I just pay for section by section? The payment is way too high for me even for a month.,5
It is absolutely brilliant! The only reason I am giving it four stars is because it is more believable and also because I've just started using the app a short while ago. It's lovely. Absolutely.,4
"One of the smartest apps of the 21st century . I strongly suggest this app if you love reading and thoroughly solving problems with detailed question and awnsers that will have you studying for hours, absolutely recommend  to everyone ! Thanks",5
The explanation for why an  answer is what it is needs to be more in depth. The explanations don't make any sense if you didn't understand the question in the first place,3
"Fantastic app. If you think that you need to start on a topic that is or has never been your forte or a topic on which you need to retrace, then brilliant is there with problems and solutions.",5
The name says it all: brilliant  I've never seen an app with so much to learn so quickly. From classical physics to machine learning to differential equations. I'll be using this for plenty of years to come.,5
Great gor testing but for the actual learning part it needs work. If I dont know how to do something all I can do is view solution (which often doesnt help much),4
"Was way better than I was expecting; makes it fun and easy to learn about new topics, and good for building intuition. Makes it really convenient to learn. Planning to upgrade to the premium version soon.",5
"Greatest app ever , I could never have found a better app than this for higher concepts . And whoever has given the info hats off dude , really great  Thanks a lot team Brilliant",5
Refreshing my review - I'm still enjoying this app a lot! It's great to have a maths/problem solving app which is more advanced than high school. Helps me keep up to date!,5
"Information is based on objective evidence and is presented in a very accessible language, using terminology when necessary. Definitely an app everyone needs to have on their phones.",5
Awesome app. Would have been better if provided with some trial period instead of locking the features for non paying users.,5
The best app that I've found for self-learning. It has been pretty helpful because it offers a lot of creative and truthful information! I highly recommend this app!,5
Well designed and clean looking app but it's absurdly expensive for things you could just google. A monthly subscription was a poor choice for a business model.,2
Consider adding some cool features such as zooming the on-screen contents. Consider adding more topics from chemistry and biology.,3
This app is too good.  I love it for math problems & solution. Should upgrade with more data,5
"The app is brilliant. But there's too much that's only available on premium; stuff that many interested people would like to get involved in, but not all of whom would accept to pay for the premium.",4
This is really brilliant for a brain-hack app! Put me forward to study more just what I need to.,5
"Preparing for college/grad school or just continuous learning, this app blows me away.  Can not wait to see where you can take it.  Brilliant IP",5
"An excellent start to simplified education. Great courses, only hope to see a bit of expansion of topics in the future.",5
Its over all a good application but this is not for people who want to have a higher education with little money. I would love to have finished but couldnt because of expenses,3
4stars. You should try to use smaller vocabulary. It is difficult to understand questions for non native English speakers.,4
A polished and well made platform for education. Excellent for picking up new concepts and getting feedback on your learning.,5
"You actually are completely monetising the app.Literally like most other apps you haven't left anything free users.So I think this is a waste of time, if you are not ready to pay.",1
Great app. Very good questions but the problem is 95% stuff is locked,4
"Lots of good material, I'm glad it's fairly specific - i.e with machine learning/ANNs rather than making them tiny sections in CompSci. Similarly with Solar energy in physics",5
"A very user friendly app, with solutions to make it easier to understand. Excellent for even beginners also.",5
I think it should contain a mind map of all the topics and subtopics.. So that we are aware of how much is getting done..... Also helps with the sales.  :-p.....,5
I think it is a great app if you love problem solving. This is the app for math and science lovers . I enjoyed solving problems.,5
"So much fun! I feel smarter, and definitely learnt much more than I would've if I listened to a teacher lecture...try the logic puzzles!",5
"Expensive, sparse problem set, broken code boxes that are half visible. Looking forward to when this idea of interactive learning is done right.",2
You are just awesome guys  Thanks for all valuable info  I Have an exam in neural network and I think this app will help a lot,5
The problems and explanations are great but you can only solve the introduction problems and community problems for free. You have to pay for the rest which everyone might not be able to do.,3
Really enjoying it.its making the learning process more awesome!  I really want to thank brilliant team for this 👍👍!,5
This app and its questions are in a league of its own. Nothing in the play store can match the brilliance of this app!,5
"Excellent app for keeping your mind sharp. Thanks for the recommendation, Michael from Vsauce!",5
I am a Post-Doctoral researcher at Indian Institute of Science. I think this app is lucid and follows a natural course to make the followers understand the underlying beauty of Mathematics.,5
I like it and would buy packets if you could buy certain sections rather than subscribe to the app as a whole 😀😊 great app keep it up,4
Very nice and interesting app... recommended to All physics and math lovers..,5
Really like the app. Love the weekly challenges. Also love how much you can do in this app.,5
"It's AMAZING!! I didn't know how to solve linear differential equations at all, but with this app Im a master at them now.",5
Definitley better than being on YouTube figuring out what to watch. This is real brain power exercise. Totally recomend.,5
Great app interactive feature is a welcome notification. Good for the whole family,5
Fun and challenging. Giving it to my 5yo occasionally. She enjoys reading about the problem and then thinking about it,5
Brilliant! as the title goes. This is how I like to pass time. :D,5
No doubt to give it 5 stars...amazing...excellent...and yeah I love it...and let me tell u I don't pay but still find the accessible parts very handy,5
"Get it.  Worth getting premium as well, the topics go very deep but constructed in a very effective way, similar to a language app like duolingo.",5
"Good app, premium is worth it. I wish they would tell us what topic they are updating next and what's the ETA.",4
Really good app... I like it a lot... The only problem is that it Needs money to be able to get all the courses...,5
Don't rest on your laurels. Keep making it more amazing!,3
You really think I'm paying monthly for a bunch of proble! That could possibly be incorrect,1
"Omg!! This app is amazing, I love it!!!. Your the right person for this. It can really improve your thinking skills.",5
Want to say thanks for the help and the excellent content.  Love it,5
This app is unstable with some pages failing to produce a stable display. Unless this is resolved it is useless,2
Amazing. I love the concept and I love the puzzles. Very high quality,5
Thanks for some more marvelous questions ro ponder over.,5
Wonderfully designed application for learner.. it would be good if all topics are available for free.,4
Great questions and make you want to learn and enjoy the way the world works,5
"Helpful, challenging and educational! The content is simply amazing!",5
These problems are encouraging me to recall stuff that my brain hasn't done in years. I'm enjoying the challenge.,5
"Generally this makes me feel much less knowledgeable than I thought. However, I do learn so much from it that I feel better in the end.",5
Darn paywall! Great content though,4
"The images are not loading in my phone or computer. Other than that, it's good.",4
"Brilliant is simply Brilliant!!! Has awesome courses and man, no one can die unemployed if they have this app.😂😂",5
"Best mind entangling questions and their solutions, which if made free, There might not be another puzzling app in its competition!",5
It's fun challenging and great I would give a little bit more options for free though but still many subjects to get through,5

"Awfully unhelpful. Not even 10 minutes into the app and the ""game of chance"" section marks every question I do wrong. Questions don't have definite answers, contradict themselves, and are very subjective to the creators' perspective. Would give 0 stars if possible.",1
"Education behind a paywall. Unfortunately this is a major problem in the world today. All of the same information can be learned for free by more experienced people. (For instance you can take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course offered for free by Stanford University). This app provides no innovation, no new information and no new service. It is a simple copy of many education services and only serves to extract cash from people who have trouble with self education.",2
"Poor attempt to be an educational app. It doesn't explain or guide you through but quiz you. The app expects you already know the subject you are trying to learn, which makes its learning process extremely frustrating and makes me want to throw my phone to the ground.",2
Showed my answer as incorrect when it was the same as there solution. Every time I moved to a new problem it selected an answer at random. No way to report in app about a bug. I liked brilliant when I tried it on web.,1
"The app is brilliantly executed, but the monthly subscription fee is not at all enticing. I can appreciate the work put into it, but I'm not willing to plonk down monthly fees for any app. Especially since I can take a local course for less than the yearly cost.   The app is great. If you decide to offer a flat fee, I'd consider it again.",4
"Let me play it the first time around but i haven't been able too get on it since. Been trying for 3 days now and i keep getting the unable to connect to brilliant right now, message. Not sure what the problem is but fix it and youll def have 5 stars i enjoyed what little i got to play",2
The questions it ask you are completely irrelevant all would be the correct answer but it tells you one is only acceptable one answering even though there would be no difference between some of the answers they're just worded differently for example the first question it gave me with the quarter I can prove mathematically that first question could be answered correctly with any answer that was given with the multiple choice answers that were given there are other apps out there that are better than this,1
"Great app with solid content. The price makes it super inaccessible. If it was just a one time 5-10 $ buy, they would probably make more and build a stronger following.",3
"There is very little to keep me coming back to Brilliant! It's UI is shoddy, the quizzes aren't engaging enough a x there is no way to integrate Google Play Games.",2
"This is going to sound like such a cliche thing to say but with so many basic level games, it's so satisfying to find a mentally stimulating game like this 1 that is still so interesting. For once there is no guilt at all if you spend hours playing.",5
Just wanted to give it the 6th star if it existed... I specifically liked the mathematical column of the app... Great app for learning and critical thinking.... Just hope that it gets better with every new updates,5
"I have a problem with the symmetry question related to alphabet letters in the subject of group theory; the symmetry axis of letters S, N and Z also do not exist. The answer should be 11 not 8.",4
"It doesn't work at all. I've tried many times to login with no sucess.. when I finally loged in, it keeps saying it is offline and doesn't go anywhere",1
"The best ""e-learning"" app that I came across.  If you have a desire to learn math and science, do not pass this up",5
"Hey, the stuff I am doing here is some of the stuff I did in college. So I can use this app to get ahead. Thanks guys!!!",5
The way of teaching fundamental scientific principles is innovative and fresh. The method used keep the user involved and also help him.clear  his doubts while going through an excercise.,5
"Rated it 5 stars before even installing, just because I know how good and exceptional the questions were in the web version. This is clearly one of the best apps for Maths + Science",5
I use this app (as well as the web based vetsion) for myself as regular mind puzzles and as challenge problems for my High School Math students. Thanks.,5
"Awesome game but WAY too expensive for an app. $20 one time purchase is a lot for an app, but $20 a month is absurd.",2
I feel like this type of learning is far more beneficial than somewhat similar sites like luminosity. For me step by step learning like brilliant is the easiest way for me to grasp complicated concepts.,5
This app reignited my spark and passion for math. I enjoy learning something new everyday in ways that keep me engaged. Great app for everyone,5
This is really great app for revising and practicing mathematics. I also love having things explained  differently from my teacher as it helps broaden my understanding. I have absolutely no complaints. Simply awesome,5
We had a course in college that was structured around the quiz while you learn method and it was a hit. This is a fantastic way to learn in your spare time while keeping it simple and fun,5
"Should be completely free. Most people don't have the money to pay the full 
amount but still it's a great app to teach themselves.",4
Very good scientific app indeed. But there should have been more content for free.,4
Hmm the best I have ever used..... have been helping me to learn something new everyday .... just if it had been totally free... and yah would love landscape mode too,5
Gives a vivid overview of scientific concepts. Really beneficial to enhance analytical power and grab command over scientific prospects.,5
"Educational, challenging, fun! A great way to learn science and math concepts.",5
I wish more people were occupied with apps like this rather than typical social media sites... Maybe we would have an educated generation rather than a self entitled one.,5
This isn't useful if you want to learn something. If you want to play a quiz game it might be OK.,1
Thank you brilliant.... my applicatication oriented thinking has now boosted by 150%,5
"Bloody brilliant and beautifully made! Active participation(through quizzes, puzzles, etc) while learning is better than reading and better than watching!",5
excellent tool for learning. please add the coming soon segments especially machine learning,4
"Very fun quizzes, I'm not sure I'll subscribe yet, but if I get through the free stuff and still want more I'll do it!",5
This app seems great but everytime i answer a question it sends me back to the login screen,4
The probability piece is just plain wrong. I had to stop playing because it was so glaringly wrong it made the app seem like a waste of time.,1
"Stimulating, logical, & enjoyable game. Keeps you coming back for more",5
This app will change ypur life its an brilliant app.U must try this or u will regret why i didnt.It has any topics answer that you want to know.,5
Amazing thought process behind the structure. Helps learn concepts clearly,5
Really makes you think.  So I guess its doing its  job.  Lol,5
Would like to see more specific topics in future suck as engineering. Over all quite valuable to inrich knowledge out side of school.,5
"Very good app for improving problem solving techniques in Maths.At every level,you get to learn lots of ideas by attempting the problems.",5
"Great app, an amazing way to spend time, huge variety og mqth problems ranging from easy to difficult. All in all, a very entertaining app",5
Problem with Python coding are hard to modify the code. Landscape mode or better code scrolling control may help on.,4
Pretty cool I've been looking for an app like this and not been able to find one that wasn't paid. Its challenging and has a lot of variety.,5
"It is still in development,some topics are coming soon.But it is costs too much,and doesn't have a full excess trial period.",5
Very brainy and useful questions. Ment for brilliant by brilliant,5
"So much learning, it's sad that i have no money to upgrade my account :(",4
"Slick modern design, extensive, gradual learning platform. In addition, there is a thriving international community of problem solvers to exchange ideas.",5
The app is great. Only thing that it is missing is more ways to pay for premium version ect.,5
"Pretty interesting app it's easy to understand ,practical, a masterpiece for someone as curious as me.",4
We want problem of the day not problems of week. And focus more on mathematics rather than physics or chemistry,5
Great way to learn a new topic. Or review one to keep fresh!,5
One of the best learning apps out there! I would surely recommend this to everyone.,5
Helps develop your mind like I've never seen before. Well deserved 5*,5
"If I know the answer I feel brilliant, if I don't know the answer, there's an easy to understand way of explaining why I got it wrong.",5
Great explanations and logical progression of knowledge & difficulty. Wish the app went landscape for code examples.,5
"Cool problems, wish they had more free content",4
It would be nice if more were available in the free version.,4
"Each topic is dealt in depth and the content is split into many small chunks with relevant diagrams, which makes learning more interesting",5
Requires login upfront - value proposition fail.,1
"Guys, this is really a very great app...the problems are interesting..U can create ur own problems and if u can't solve something, u can also see the solution,...really gr8 app !:) #happytoget",5
"Lots of paid stuff, very little free stuff.",4
It's great stimulus for our mind and it is a good source to be in constant touch with basics without actually indulging in pure study's.,5
"As an ex-physics teacher, I found this app really interesting to teach and remind basics in funny way.",5
"App experiencing problems , can't play",2
good way to put our brains into work.....sharpen a bit up,5
Awesome app with awesome ques... But i wish it was free...,4
"Got it to help with school and it is doing the job it says it will, totally recommended for all students.",5
"Top-notch puzzles, wide array of subjects",5
Brilliant challenging fun questions to challenge your brain and thinking.,5
"Brilliant app, but a bit pricey",4
The app is great but I just miss the old days when it was free.,5
useful and fun way to get my brain working on the go.,5
It is an awesome app if you want to keep your brain sharp!,5
"I still need to try the premium version, but it is quite complete to be honest",5
"Fun, keeps you thinking, for an oldie like me",5
Lets you learn the concepts step by step at your own pace.,5
This app is just BRILLIANT (pun intended),5
I love puzzles and there is such a great variety of them.,5
It is really helpful for those people who love to solve problem.,5
The app just loads forever on the blue loading screen with the green loading circle.,5
It helpful to me and have alot of example to understand when i have problems with difficult words and new words.,5
Wonderful place to learn and get brain teasers.,5
Great app to keep the neurons firing up!,5
enjoyable. might purchase plan near future,5
As a math major this app is super fun for when I'm bored and would rather be solving problems than be on Twitter,5
Awesome app. Makes your brain x100,5
Finally something something productive I can do on my phone when I am bored.,5
From easy to rock hard problems. I love the number theory problems.,5
"Why all the contents are paid, please make some of them free",1
annoying that you cant go back to the former questions but a good learning device in general,5
"I'm unable to find the  100 day challenge on the app , Can I only play it on my PC ?",5
"Lots of challenging and good questions , very helpful for students",5
Nope! Not signing in/ joining to play a game...not happpening,1
great app but expensive subscription :),4

"This does not in any way teach you to think like a scientist, as they  claimed. I think like a scientist with logic, accuracy, and precision, and this app did not help me in any way. They had no process for teaching you how to get the answers, only faulty solutions that would not teach you how to get the answers. They even said that videos don't help, although they were sponsoring one of my favourite YouTube channels, SciShow. If you want to learn something, I suggest watching that channel, reading a book, or having real world experience that teaches you about STEM and other things.  Ps- from a scientific mind, these questions will make no logical sense, and not explaining it well. For example, the answer to whether irrational numbers will always add up to be irrational is explained with e+(3-e), which is basically adding 0 to 3, and gives no further explanation on why that is so. And they said that you can get a cork to float in the center of a glass of water if you fill it completely, which is impossible. The meniscus of the water will always exist, and it was assumed that you could get it to be at the same level, which, even if you did (which you wouldn't), when you put the cork in, it would overflow and thus not be completely filled. You learn this in grade school, people.",1
"Brilliant seemed to be what I needed as an at home tutor or study tool, but after I was prompted to pay for the solutions to the problems I got wrong, it turned me away from this product.  I understand that this required for the creators to make a profit, but there are other ways of doing this than requiring payment for understanding.  The concepts, subjects, and lessons were all great, but if I can not learn from my mistakes on material that is free, what is the point?",3
"Challenging. A very welcome change in the now usual self-improvement approach of playing games and a nice mix of teaching, testing and sharing STEM knowledge, whilst providing a neat space for like-minded individuals to interact outside of other types of education centres/tools. Agreed: some super helpful solutions, these people ARE brilliant!",5
Amaizing app with amaizing courses! The only issue I have is the wording on some problems creates by the users but the app has nothing to do with this. I hope this will help me with my upcomimg math competition and GSF. :D,5
"Very easy to use, with fantastic information and a great positive community. I'm really good at getting a problem and researching how to solve it on my own but I do wish they would have a glossary of sorts for some of the more complicated concepts and terms.",5
"Its just amazing...!!Thats it! Well done Team Brilliant... It is helping me a lot in improving my logical understanding,nice tricky sums,concepts of physics,truth tellers...etc... I loved it.",5
"This app is now my favorite app. I first loved it for the free weekly puzzles, but once I bought the yearly subscription I found their amazing courses they offer. Now I'm using this app for all of my computer science learning, it's absolutely amazing. I mean it even has runnable python code on the app!",5
Sit down and challenge yourself. It is worth exploring the demand your brain wishes to know. This game or challenge gives you that very opportunity.,5
This is the best of its kind. I love it. When I am bored I just start solving some problem and learn something new.,5
"There are a number of ""probability"" questions that try to put a quantitative number on the human mind.  It just doesn't that way",1
"Are amazing question for mathematics and other stuff. Even the step-by-step ""studying"" are make realy good.",5
Best app . lot's of good questions. .n use full app.,5
"Error on viewing somethink, happen occasionaly too.. uninstalling",3
This is the best engineering app I've used. I learn new things from first principles every time I use it.,5
Knowledge should be free ! Especially with such well made courses,4
Brilliant the name itself describes about the app. Simple logic to something innovative.,5
best app I have ever seen....keep us updated with more quiz,5
"I have been looking for an app like this for nearly forever, a fun and clever way of learning!",5
Simply clever keeps your brain up-to-date and fresh,5
Fun and way above what I thought any game would be as far as available information and level of what is listed.,5
It's fun and keeps you thinking by sending you notifications.,5
Great for expanding your knowledge and learn new concepts,5
Educative App....a lot of scientific knowledge...,5
The Great app for math&physics  lover .....,5
"As its  name suggest , the app is Brilliant !!!!!",5
Best math app ever!!,5
It helped me with my 7th grade astronomical class,4
"Please include conic sections ,curves and surfaces and their geometry",5
Good to get you thinking.,5
Brilliant idea of what you have,5
Good and nothing else to say,5
I already feel smarter lol,5
"Excellent apps ,",5
Improves me a lot,5
Premium mustn't be there,4
Terrific.,5
Loved it :),5
I just started,5
Its paid. Except for that the best app I've ever seen so far,4
Great app... but the pricing should  be adjusted according to the buying power of different currencies...,5
Active learning is the best way to consolidate concepts and this app provides that and more,5
Awesome but still quite complex in terms of explaining facts,5
Excellent app but please add millennium questions in it,5
Extraordinarily Amazing. Keep up the great work.,5
Good app leaving legacy of papers,5
Worst app in the world,1
Still using it,4
"Overall, a great app. The only issue is I find it pretty hard to figure out how I can manage the subscription. The app ""account setting"" pqge opens a web view in which it says you should open the app to manage subscription.",4
"I haven't unlocked premium, although this is an app I would be willing to pay for. This is one of the few apps of this caliber that doesn't feel incomplete without being a paying user.",5
"Major disadvantage - chargable content, solutions. Otherwise, great app.",3
Awesome app... Consists of good question,4
Brilliant app.. nice content.,4
A whole community dedicated to active learning and problem solving. Really engaging for those who want to get nerd-sniped repeatedly.,5
Awesome app 😊,5
Fun. Free. Wonderful!,5
It is all I needed to learn,5
Awesome and educational,5
Brilliant for brilliance,5
"Brilliant is a great app for anyone who is interested in Maths and Science or is simply revising for a topic at college, school or university. Brilliant explains many different topics in a way that is much more clear than that of a teacher or tutor. I'm 13 and although I don't learn about these Maths and Science topics until later years, I am genuinely interested in many of these topics and it is extremely useful for anyone who wants to learn certain areas and doesn't have anyone to teach them. However, many topics can only be unlocked if you have a premium membership, I believe you have to pay monthly or yearly. I personally don't want to waste money on things that I could easily learn through the internet. To conclude, Brilliant is great at explaining and the app's content is fantastic, although learning is limited due to in-app purchases. That sure took a while to write.",4
"The service is quite expensive, but is certainly a fantastic teaching tool. Best way to learn math/sciencr on mobile I've found so far, despite it's so far limited selection of topics.   The only things I'd recommend (besides increasing the size of the library, let's see a detailed treatment of Relativity) is to have the problems use varying numbers for quiz retakes, and have answers already completed be red or green depending on your response.",5
"free problems are great, some can be very challenging. studying something else very concentrated at the moment, nice to relax or stretch other gen math logic skills. of course there is premium content but the development seems to be there for it, I just can't justify the premium content over just buying a text and reading/working through it",5
This was presented as learning app on YouTube... But it doesn't give you any explanation of needed math before the exercises nor it does very good job at explaining solution. Again sometime it uses math without explaining what is it.,3
I only got the app for a few days but I am totally amazed by it. I was looking for a handy opportunity to train my math and science skills for a long time and seem to have found it here. My background is a bachelor in physical chemistry and I am currently working on my masters in theoretical chemistry. While I was doing quite well in all mathematical and physical topics as they were on the curriculum I feel my ability decreasing in some areas due the lack of practice this app encourages me to practice and sharpen my mental tools to be a better scientist.,5
I think brilliant is a good source for everybody who is sufferring from solving math equation because it gives you information about the problem and you can solve the problem next time around haha. This app is really good for me. Thank you for making this application because I appreciate on how you give attention to details on it.,5
Fantastic way to learn. So much material and many questions to choose from. The community questions are a great resource too.   I have an engineering degree and still find many of the questions challenging and revealing of how much I have forgotten or just never understood fully in the first place. For that reason I find Brilliant a fantastic resource.,5
This is just absolutely BRILLIANT! literally! I've always wanted one of these! And here it is 😱 thank you so much! You guys are awesome! Keep updating! The only thing that needs to change.. Well at least for me.. Is the interface.,5
Really like it so far! Amazing quality and easy to use! The only I am missing is the ability to write a short note to myself of slides. Maybe it is a question or an idea that I could review afterwards. Thank you for your work!,5
"app is good and very helpful, i just hate subscriptions. i want the propiety of something if i pay. if i want to keep quizzes and lessons for the future i have to constantly pay for it, so i get a book.",3
Just a great ap which gives you some fun interesting questions. The kind which you don't really get in school. Maybe a bit hard for younger kids but is great practice for UKMT and other things.,5
"I enjoy the weekly challenges. I just wish there was a way to unlock more of the categories, like getting 100% on the beginning few teats. Instead of having to pay for more of the tests.",4
It's a good app for learning a wide variety of topics. I use it a lot to review the topics I might have forgotten and helps me practice them through quizzes. There are also topics that have new information that I haven't heard and they are interesting.,5
"Disappointing that the app doesn't support landscape orientation.  I'd really like to use it with my Pixel C in ""laptop configuration"" with the keyboard, but it's frustratingly locked to portrait orientation on screen.",4
Amazing amount of content for free. The puzzles are fun and challenging. Very diverse array of topics.,5
Sometimes there have some good question that we need to think widely to get the answer. Thx for improve my mathematics.,5
It is a good app for practicing mathematics in both the lower and upper level. It's premium features are a bit pricy though.,5
Quizzes are very good. It's fun to solve them. The yearly subscription is cheap enough. Waiting for some discount to pop up though.,5
"Very well done. I'd really like a lifetime subscription option rather than a yearly subscription, but this service is challenging and worth every penny.",5
Great job.  Can't thank you enough,5
This is one of the best application I've ever had for years. This has always been helping me to improve my understanding in every situation.,5
Free topics are nice but are few in numbers. Mostly there are paid topics which are very expensive,4
I started struggling with science recently and have been losing interest in it but this app really helps me enjoy it again. 5 stars,5
This it's like a trivia game that also teaches you how to get better for next time it's fantastic to learn new things in a way that is fun.,5
Great common sense puzzles to keep the mind sharp. Well built app.,5
"Too many of the quizzes cost, and it is very quick to finish.",4
Would have given 5 however I can't see the discussions page for questions can you fix this bug,4
"The price is too high, otherwise it's a good game.",4
Great for part time learning! Satisfactorily detailed solutions.,5
It's insightful but many courses are payed and I would rather like it free,4
"When I was registering and inserting birth day, I got to know in what day of the week it was. 10/10 would learn I was born in a Friday again.",5
Great mind benders! Keeps you on your toes...,5
"Is not only a good way to exercise your mind as in a puzzle, it also teaches you interesting information.",5
Amazingly addictive and worth checking out you won't be able to get enough!,5
I may be hooked...and encouraging my daughter to play as well.,5
"The most brilliant app on my phone, I wish it was free for everyone to learn more.",5
"It's a great application focusing on every aspect of mathematics, helped me greatly when dealing with differential equations",5
Keeps you sharp on math and science through intriguing and deep problems,5
"Awesome, unfortunately students can't afford the full app 😢",5
"You learn how to solve each problem in different ways,soo cool!!",5
A great way to learn math and improve critical thinking skills.,5
Its a better app for students and has fantastics way of learning.,5
"Awful, must do quizzes, too basic",1
I love the app - a great refresher on lots of material!,5
It's so useful  If it had more free content that would be awsome,5
Makes you think logically about math and gives you a challenge but yet dosent make it impossible to solve,5
I don't even have the paid version and its still my favorite pooping app...,5
Beautiful layout and simple yet hugely informative lessons.,5
We can find and interact problems created by geniuses and get to see the best possible solutions for them,5
Very well written I would like to say.,5
Good app for keeping your brain sharp.,5
Excellent for assessing the Intelligence of those in your presence!!!👏👏🙌🙏,5

Education with a click,5
Well improve it,5
"A good app with a wide range of very specific topics. The free edition does not have enough content to be useful to me, so it seems paying the subscription is necessary. It's a very expensive subscription for this kind of app, but I think it will definitely be worth it if you're serious about learning.",5
I love it so much and it teaches me so many new concepts. It's just that the full version is so expensive...,5
This is an app for which i was looking since birth. I was kidding. This is a wonderful app with so many quantitative questions. I loved the app,5
Awesome app. Would love it if it was free with ads to compensate for the lack of subscription income,5
Excellent app. It helps keep my mathematics and analytical skills sharp during vacations.,5
Really gud learning app if I were a little younger.,4
It's a wonderful app I recommend getting the pro version although the free version has enough...,5
Keeps me thinking and it's  a good distraction when I'm stuck on a coding problem.,5
I'm in Deep lust with Maths,5
Absolutely Brilliant!,5
This app is actually brillant,5
None of the pictures load.,2
Brilliant work,5
Greatest of All,5
It's  fun,5
Certainly helps make one think,5
10 star,5
Brest ever,5
"I love the idea of this app and its simplictic lay out,as well as the broad topics it covers,but on multiple answers to questions the apps rated me as choosing the wrong option,only to read the explanation and see it explain why my answer is right. Probably a simple mistake of which answer is which when the app is loading and processing the questions and answers, but after running out of the limited explanations i obviously cant tell wether my answer is wrong or not. And despite how much i love the complex topics of this app,on the other hand some topics iv tried to go into and learn about,theres virtually no basic explanations on the topic,and i enjoy a challenge,but being asked very complicated questions when your just starting up a topic i think it would be useful to be able to adjust the level of difficulty per topic. I could have over looked this type of setting but i cant seem to find anything of the sort in the app. Besides this bug and mild annoyance it is a fantastic app!!!",3
Oh look! A paywall. Instant 0. I have books with great questions for my money. Also. Kind of pointless to repeat the test ad verbatim after not completing it..,1
"I love the selection of mathmatic applications and the high learning curve overall. You will FAIL over and over again but when you finally pass the selected course, you'll feel like a genius. 5/5 highly recommend and this is the best mathematics app on here.",4
The app is great and has many interesting topics and features. However i think the cost is a bit too high. I am a student so i can't afford the fees. So it will be great if you could add a version with ads perhaps.,4
"It's the BEST EVER free learning app I have ever seen. Really loved the concept of quiz-based learning and I am addicted to it.  In fact, it's better app for competitive exam preparation as well, as compared to so-called preparation apps.",5
"Proof that learning is the most addictive game of the lot.  My only issue is navigation which could be better - certainly not brilliant, but the actual puzzles, explanations and overall idea is Brilliant.  I wonder how far they can take it.",5
"You have to pay for everything. The questions are trick questions and there is much more thorough and in-depth material out there on these topics for free on youtube, coursera, Khan academy, etc.",1
"It is a wonderful app. It takes a problem solving approach to Maths and Science and makes you really appreciate the topics taught. It has given me new insight and understanding in topics I thought I knew and helps you build intuition. I purchased a one month subscription, and don't regret it at all. Next purchase I make might be for a year straight.",5
"Way too expensive. 7.99 a month??? Give me a version with advertising instead, would likely reach a larger audience. I can't justify a higher rating with this cost",2
This is a great and challenging app. It really helped me fill up summer vacation and is honestly the challenge I was looking for. Even when you feel stupid for not being able to solve a problem if you keep trying you'll figure it out. So if your a nerd like me you'll love this app.☺,5
Great app. I love the premise and execution. Good questions to stay sharp and understand more topics.,5
"Even When Wrong it's Right The problems are presented with well explained solutions. As you work through them much comes back to you. It's not a got to get it right exercise, but a keep rebuilding your skills exercise.",5
Great practice. Fun. Great minds do math. Thanks,5
I always wanted an app that allow ne to review all these topics in a fun way. Thanks.,5
"This is incredible.  Stuff I never learned,  I'm terrible in math.",4
Thought I had an understanding of physics. This app gently showed me that I do not. Get it!,5
"This  app is amazing in educating in all aspects actually,truly,I wish some features could be free and if they coils organize a sort of offline feature",5
Can't confirm that I want to deactivate. Won't let me press the button in order to deactivate my account,1
If only I have much time I would love to answer each questions everyday.,5
Nice to keep your brain engaged and review math concept,5
Interesting but large barrier in pricing.    $8 a month is a stretch.,2
It's literally very informative. Some of the things should be free of charges.,5
Excellent apps keep my thinking skills up to par good cognitive thinking troubleshooting problem solving,4
This app is very much usefull...  It helped me alot I like it 😊😊,5
This app is a great way to challenge yourself with all sorts of interesting puzzles. Definitely one of my all-time favorites!,5
A great way to keep your mind sharp and learn a lot along the way. Highly recommend.,5
Very nice app. I love it but the only problem is that lot of it requires a subscription,5
This is just brilliant. I think I can use this knowledge in my day to day life.,5

"It's a great app, I recommend for every learner.",5
"Math has always been a weak spot for me, but this app makes it more intriguing and holds my interest.",5
"Better than Kahn Academy, great for higher math skills!",5
Perfect. It should have a simple notebook optional so thatwecan sketch some notes,5
Awesome ap everyone should download it it is payable but almost everything is opened of I request everyone to download it,5
Enjoying the app but can't justify the price,4
A receptive mind is all that need to make most of this wonderful app.,5
You can learn so much stuff in a really interesting way.,5
Great app for maths and science lovers.,3
Great for teaching math to my kids,5
How can I refund?..I bought it just by mistake.,1
Simply amazing. I recommend using this for entrance exam preparations,5
Amazing! I'm definitely leaning algebraic thinking,5
"i really hope this app is free though, the price's too picky for a edu app",5
Detective's app. Great one!,5
Good one.. but almost everything is paid,5
A great app for improving your math skills.,5
Pretty cool way to stimulate your mind when you're bored,5
Great puzzles to solve while learning and having fun,5
Best thing ever! Loved it.,5

This is a really great learning resource. I wish a few more features would have been available for free. I'll definitely buy the lifetime subscription when the price goes down a little bit. Edit: The price does go down if you use the site regularly. They offered me a discount on the yearly plan and I claimed it. I'm very satisfied. 😊,5
Very cool... I'm not much of a math fanatic but this app delivers in a more profound and fun manner. I'm intrigued and challenged to think in new ways.,5
An extraordinary application! The quizzes are exciting and the community is lively. Brilliant is oddly addictive and with continued use you begin to notice that you learn a lot really fast. The quality of the material here is simply off the charts. Kudos to all involved in making this possible.,5
I wish I could afford the full app. It's a huge learning tool and has an absolute ton of fun puzzles to solve.,5
Truly nice!! But everyone can't buy premium!! It should be noticed!!,5
It's mindblowing,5
This helps alot to the quizers,5
A great app where you can learn anything just like khan academy but it's not free(completely). For most things you need a subscription. Also the 100 day summer challenge is not available in the app,3
A BRILLIANT app!  Nicely done.  And thank you for making it available.,5
"The app has very limited free content you can use it for free for a very limited time then you have to pay money to unlock new content you can't unlock anything for free,the content and puzzles are good though hence the 2 star",2
"Brain stimulating and a very good way of challenging one's self. Who says you can only find fun ""in"" a bottle of beer.",5
Nice app but you can't play without paying monthly payment. You have just a demo for free!!!,1
This is the best maths app in history,5
Wonderful app which teaches in an efficient way,5
My brain is a bit slow these days since I'm becoming vintage and all :) Well this app is really keeping my brain sharp and helps me learn new things so I can keep up and teach my teens❕  It's fun and you don't even realize your learning! I love it!,5
You'll be surprised by what you really know!,5
Very informational in the way I want to learn what it is,5

"The themes are varied but the content precise and challenging with everyday applications. The app is well-designed, with nice illustrations and quizzes. Absolutely worth it!",5
Uninstalled this app a while ago but I've downloaded it again and the new design is so much better. The content is great and mentally stimulating. Fantastic.,5
I really enjoyed the free quizzes but the thing is I thought all of it was free. Of course I would have to pay to take more than the introduction quizzes. Just when I thought I had found a good app.,3
"Great for when you're looking for a short term distraction, some way to spend time for a bit without feeling like you're wasting it. Educational and accessible, two things that rarely go together. Great stuff.",5
Education is the sole manifestation of a perfect man and the app provides me with questions which enhances my logical and reasoning power. Yes truly this app has something which will invoke you to think.........................,5
Awesome content... Enriched with new questions... Addictive but in a knowledgeable way,5
"Great application, along with the Khan Academy it's must-have app for anyone who wants to polish his/her math skills!",5

The best app ever for a unskilled person in maths like me. The wikis are great and the questions encourage me to learn more and more. The only problem was the price. Please try to reduce it,5
This app has helped me gain the bare basic concept of number theory and it's applications. It's a beautifully designed app with mind-blowing questions.,5
"This is super informative and makes learning fun. The questions are interesting and tricky, with elaborate explanations. A nerd's favourite pastime.",5
"It is a good app ,it opens our mind much easier than a book can do. Its a good way of learning",5

Pretty great for learning. I use it because school is so boring and holds me back. Really great app.,4
The first app to really get me into calculus. Thank you!,5
İf I could see all contents including wiki in offline mode it would be awesome please work on more offline mode because I have no access to Internet at everywhere,5

Absolutely brilliant!!!,5
"I'm sure it's a great app and from what i seen it most likely is. The problem is that I didn't see much because of the paywalls which saddens me because it looks, again great and I'm not able to pay for it. I'm stuck at a school where you do nothing and get a 93 for the year, and it's depressing and I'm desperate to educate myself.",3
"I have been a user for the past 2 years. The only reason i used brilliant was for the daily problem set, it was pretty good for daily practice.  The weekly problems are not good enough in level and variety.  It is disappointing.",2
"Downloaded this to help me get to grips with maths once and for all, but I can't understand the questions, let alone work them out! Thanks for making me feel inferior",2
"There are a lot of so interesting issues about math ,chemistry and other part of science .Great thanks .",5
Awesome app. Really useful. Makes my brain more sharp. All the puzzles are tricky. Best puzzle app I have ever used.,5
I puts my brain to work in a way that I actually want to understand the concepts. It's great.,5
"Awesome . But can be better add more features like of your website, notification and all only 2 stars to app but for website deserves much more than 5",5
"Brilliant? More like Billy Ant! Get it? Because: 1. They bill(y) you like crazy. 2. Annoying as an ant. Naw, just kidding. I learned so much and never needed to pay.",5
"It looks amazing, but you can only do a few puzzles for free and the premium is really expensive :-(",1
The premium is expensive and they could have made more quizez free. You can only do a few quizez before you have to uninstall the app,2
"Amazing problems, with each sum you get to learn alot...If anyone wants a mental exercise, I highly recommend them to install brilliant",5
"Now,excellent. But ,I can't be able to post any question.",5
Gives very little content without a subscription. Just get a book and do the exercises.,1
My only complaint is that you can't unlock everything with one lump payment. This isn't something I'd want to pay for more than once.,5
"The interface can be a little strange, but the content is great.",5
Fun and entertaining. Keeps my mind sharp. Love it.,5
It has many engaging and exciting problems and money(purchase pack) being one of them,4
Great app! Fun if you like to problem solve,5
It's good app. It would be awesome if there was no any premium version within,5
Could use some explanation and not just problems... :/,4
"If you love math, then this is the app for you. If you don't like math, then it will make you fall in love with math.",5
Good fun and makes me think. I also like other people's comments.,5
"It used to work finely but lately it stops working, expecially in the community section",4
Great mental exercise when you need to take your mind off everything else :),5
"This app is fabulous ,but there are network issues and this app is very slow in loading.",4
Very good app for the few and proud that like to do more than tap and slash,5
Fun and a good way to waste time.,4
Great! Super fun. Learning made easy.,5
Would be happy if it was one time pay,4
"It's good, you should download it.",5
"Brilliant as its name,Useful for all levels,loved it",5
This app clearly understands you and helps you in making your concepts,5
"Very nice app, nice brain warmer.",5
For days when work doesn't require enough thought,5
Great app for math and science on a lazy day.,5
"Great problems, but wish it wasn't a paid app",5
Super fun. So far!,5
Very helpful in strengthning the basics...,4
"Teaches you in practical, understandable ways",5
Very nice app .,4

Really for brilliants,5
"There are no games with the free version, just math and quizzes. If you like these, you will enjoy it. If not, you have to pay. Monthly subscription rates, no one-time payment here. Not worth downloading for the ""free"" version.",1
"Always add the new course and i hope you can add language option l, not only english but also indonesian. so i can learn easier, thanks a lot. Please response to​ this.",5
Yureka!Amazing app..Links the concepts with Daily life situations..We can get a great grip on concepts and develop a great interest on studies by using this app...,5
Excellent program. Needs more hype so people will experience how cool science is😎 Love the answers easy to understand.,5
"Liked parts, but some categories are boring. Best is ""joy of problem solving."" Solutions and explanations are good.",4
"It wont load me the pictures inside the app, witch makes it a bit harder, if not imossible, to solve a problem.",3
It's a great app. but can i change language to french?,5
"One of the few maths apps that both challenges and teaches, it's even tempted me to pay monthly, something i never would do for an app",5
I liked it. I don't think it was a monthly subscription,3
One of the best learning apps on playstore I loved it Suggest articles be allowed to download as pdf😀😀😀😀👏👏👏,5
Keep up the good work guys (Y),5
Fun stuff to dip into now and again.,5
Nice little mental exercises. Very humbling at times.,5
Perfect name..its Brilliant! 👍,5
Excellent problems which get seriously tricky to cater for the more mathematically able.,5
Perfect for an overachieving middle schooler like me,5
Awesome way to learn new things,5
Learn while you enjoy,5
I enjoy this app it is very cool,5

"With some of the concepts that are new to me I am getting the answers wrong which is to be expected. But, the explanations are worded really flowery which stifles my understanding. For instance, if I have a choice if A B and C and C is correct, it would be nice for one to tell me WHY A and B are wrong. Also in the explanations in the geometry section it would be nice to have a visual explanation, because well, the problem is visual.",3
"This app is great! I luv it. Makes you solve questions that requires you to think, analysis and generate solutions. You can even apply them in the real world. Good work done",5
It's a pretty amazing app so much to dive into whenever you are ready. Also they offer a monthly subscription if you want to see more solutions otherwise good luck and great logic. 🍃,4
Excellent content.. challenges with people would be interesting rather than just with app..,5
"Fantastic app, well worth a subscription. Lessons are a nice size and solutions are well written and helpful. I use it every day.",5
Community problems are great but I would be happy to make brilliant full free of cost,3
Helpful for understanding the basics structure in mathematics and many other fields.,4
Really amazed me. Overall a good app having some great stuff,5
I love it.  I'm learning a lot and it  is addictive.,5
Awesome app if you like games,5
Just full of wonderful challenges.,5
Very helpful and educational,5
Please provide some discounts.,5
Benefical,5
"Good for testing what you already know. The daily quiz reminders are useful, but often drop you in the middle or end of a complex quiz. This results in either getting a failing grade for the quiz and having to do it again, or having to answer the easy questions once you've shown you can get the harder ones anyway.  Things should start at the beginning of a quiz, otherwise it defeats the purpose of the learning order!",3
Nice app. Want more thing to be included like competition between opponents,4
Great puzzles! Some hints you need to pay for.,4
Its cool...helps with practising along my uni course,5
Its really awesome .....so much thing to explore..,5
Brilliant...!! This is awesome.,5
Fun and interesting!,5
Great for all ages,5
It's an teaching application showing us a new dimension of exploration and learning the mathematics. Just too great,5
The more I get into this app the more that I enjoy it!,5
Great way to pass time.,5
Very interesting with concrete explanations.,5
Its a great app,5
"I definitely recommend this if you love to do a bit of solving in your free time. Sometimes emails are sent and they ask you to do math way over your head, but if you look into it, it's not as bad as you think.",5
For you section in older version had more relevant questions than featured placed against it,3
Mind teaser. Keeps a fresh mindset,5
Proper thinking required¡,5
Good for you...,5
pretend to be free,2
Simply amazing,5
A must have app.,5
Keeps busy,5
Looking for a good maths app as i will be studying this year....thought this was good until i subscribed and i was charged the annual cost IN FULL when I was supposed to be paying monthly...i do not want to be paying £42 this month.  I was tricked by the monthly price displayed with no option to cancel.  I have many subscriptions which have not charged me this way....Scam!!!!,1
"Really really great. For students like me and my best freind who recommended it, its really agreat way to learn. I learned nearly 3 completely new topics ovet here. Especially the kinematics is interesting....thought it is a bit difficult for me",5
Great for a quick mental test to keep the problem solving and memery recall juices flowing. Gets you thinking back to all the little tips and techniques you learned to solve these types of problems which are seen in everyday engineering and design tasks.,5
I loved this app. It's simply amazing. I have experience in geometry and this app is just...,5
Would be pretty cool if you could have a widget on the home screen that periodically gives you small problems,4
The best interactive app that stimulates every curious human. Everything's there for the taking!,5
"Seems good, but sometimes all the answers are blank, which is predictably frustrating",3
This is brilliant! (No pun intended),4
Great app that keeps you on your mental game and tests you cerebral cortex,5
"Amazing and easy to use,truly brilliant explanations!",5
I really enjoy how this app keeps me on my toes.,5
Great way to use the creative side of your brain.,5
Awesome way to keep your brain busy.,5

Good to get my brain working again,5
Brilliant premium is worth every penny!,5
برنامج رائع و مفيد جدا يعلى من نسبة الذكاء والقدرة على حل المشكلات,5
Really advanced and well presented.,5
Makes you cogitate.,5
I have no word!,5
"This app gives you many great and fun challenges in a variety of maths areas at all levels from beginner to advanced. Good for many hours of maths pleasure. But be aware, it can be very addictive.",4
"Really good fun, and very interesting. Fantastic free educational resources, and stimulating small (but challenging) puzzles.",5
"I wish there were linear algebra problems on here, but still a great app",4
They send notifications to remind me about them and the notifications catch my attention enough to keep me on the app when i wonder off for a few days,5
An amazing app has helped me do many things,5
it's really very helpful.... I just love it,5
Awesome app!! Great job done!!!,5
A app which keeps your brain ticking.,5
Good questions that make you think,5
The visuals a really great for learning the concepts,5
Brain worker oh yeah,5
Great app. Better than wasting time on social media,5
"Its a great brain exercise, just sucks that you have to pay for it",4
best app for intelligent guy like me...but the cost of premium plan mest be little low,5
It really helps to stretch some muscles in my brain that I haven't used since Calculus III.,5
"This is an incredible app, but it would be cool if you could translate it to spanish.",5
total waste very low level,1
It's a good app,4
Thanks for the quick fix.,5
Best way to learn and compete.,5
If you have a nerdy side to you and don't want to waste you time playing games. This is an awesome and challenging app,5
Nice concept but one question in first batch was wrong.,3
Excellent for students who love studying and practicing challenging questions........  I love it....it's the best  👌👌👌👌,5
Make it free every teacher student can not afford it as IaM a teacher I can't afford ot so I have go to  khans acadeMy or on other website,3
i love this app but plz make it free...,3
It's entertaining and teaching for people with different level of knowledge,5
Educational aap....,5
It pretty neat,5
Brilliant as in the name implies. Cognitively stimulating and fun.,4
Gold for problem lovers,5
"As a mathematician I find the questions themselves very interesting. However the solutions are conceptually not complete and sometimes formally wrong, i.e. there is no learning benefit. It promotes many math. and phys. concepts very wrong. On the other side it is too expensive for what it offers and should not be based on monthly fee - no real reason since there is no real service there. It is really pity since this could be a killer collection for many fields of science.",1
"I started on just the free version, and loved it. So I sent it to my 14 year old son, and his improvement in maths was amazing in just 2 weeks!! Amazing detail, not too much, and even if you get the question right in the quiz section, you can explore the solution, anyway. In the probability section, new to me, I guessed a couple of answers, and so being able to explore the solution gave me good grounding on why the answer was correct. I reckon this would be good training for exams too, for this very reason.",5
"Very engaging and interesting math puzzles. My only issue is that upgrade to premium it is a monthly fee, whereas I would rather just pay once. So I do not have premium, but it is still a great app.",5
I like the little math puzzles that are challenging & teach me something I didn't know before. Saves me from afternoon doldrums all the time.,5
I had a subscription but it got cancelled due to some reason and now the app is not accepting any of my cards. Please help me out?,4
Whenever I open a new problem it automatically submits a (normally incorrect) answer. Uninstalled.,1
Says I'm from somewhere I'm not? Odd and annoying plus I can't edit my info anywhere?,1
For 10$ a month I'd expect a lot more.  Two stars off for price and one star off for quality.,2
Love it. Really fun. When I saw the add I thought it would be boring but its not!,5
"Lots of stuff behind a pay wall, but at least a few weeks' to a few months' worth of quality learning available for free.",5
"Works well, fascinating content.",5
i haven't paid a single penny either! whoop whoop,5
Its super helpful to keep me challenged and keep my brain working,5
The image loading problem has been fixed.,4
This app will make you think on a higher level,5
It's indeed a brilliant app... 😊,5
Too much money hungry app,1
Brilliant !! it's brilliant to learn by solving problems,5
Fun for all math nerds!,5
Best brain training app,5
Challenging with very good explanations,5
Great app for creative thinking,5
Good random questions to kill time,5
Makes the gears in your brain move,5
😎 cool app,5
Its nice,5
awesome :),5
Nice.,5
Very confuito use,3
Superbbbb,5
"This app isn't challenging and doesn't help you learn anything.  If you get questions wrong it's because they word them ambiguously (which they do a ton) and not because any of the questions are actually hard. It's like that college professor we all had.  Where you're sitting in the test,  and you know the correct answer, but you don't trust the professor to actually know what the correct answer is.",1
"The app has fun questions and a fairly large library of them included in the free version. I really appreciate the 'report' feature, as there more than a few issues with questions, even within just the free version. There also seems to be an issue with the 'daily streak' feature, which seems to reset every few days.",4
It would be better if you didnt have to pay for solutions. Pointless to try and understand the concept and then not know why your answer was right or wrong...find a different way to make money in the app but overall love the idea and setup of this app,3
"I am enjoying this so far, but I think that the costs are too high. I would rather pay one amount for all the content, even a reasonably high price...",4
The question about the mice in the corners and the probability that they would collide. The answer is 1/2 either they are going to or they aren't.  Life is 50/50,3
"Its ok for fun. But for achieving any success, its jst a tympass",3
It do not show the image . It's emergency please improve it . Do it fast I want to do question,3
Its not really something you would just do but it is good for passing time otherwise its a waste of time,2
"Great fun, very interesting. Inspires me to learn more",5
Fun but way more mathematics than science,4
It's really helpful for brilliant students but for others......,3
Whenever I got to a new section on the blue bar it freezes,1
Good way to kill a few minutes waiting for life to happen...,5
Like the app and questions I find good and interesting.,3
"Brilliant is well, brilliant. It definitely helped me.",5
Keeps challenging you when you have some spare time,5
Really brilliant app...,4
It's brilliant & it makes you brilliant.,5
Definitely gets your brain working,5
It helps learn from the basic level.,5
Love it so much,5
Justify it's name.,5
Doesn't work since the update,5
I can't even create an account,1
Very addictive,5
Came back after longtime,5
Easy problems,5
Answers are frequently blank,1
Yea Math!,5

chingon,5
"Expensive to get full solutions. Also, some answers make no sense. For example: You have 10 sweets, 5 of type 'a' and 5 of type 'b'. Your friend takes a sweet without saying what they got. You then take one. What's the chance you get type 'a'? 5/10 according to this! The true answer is that you can't know without knowing which type the friend got. Uninstalled.",2
"I loved this so much I wanted to buy premium. It shows £3.50/month for 12 months. That's not actually how you pay, you want an annual subscription of £42 in one go. Sorry, but nope...monthly yes, lump sum nope.",5
"Brilliant is to learn very fun! Many interest, is well structured is have good.",5
This will help u if u don't know math,5
Yeah...,5
Awesome app. The text control(math expressions and all) from app could've been better,5
Really .. practice the challenges.. it makes you learn so much .. How to be sportive and how to think out of the box,4
Everyday life doesn't always force you to use all of the skills you've learned over time and this is a great app to remind you of what you learned years and years ago.,5
Enjoy while learning math.,5
Awesome expect,4
Superb yarrr,5
The content is accurate. The interesting questions test your knowledge quite well. The community is very supportive. Love spending long hours with this app. 👌,5
Yet another app/game which I can't play at work where there's no WiFi or mobile data!,3
I'd have subscribed if the Subscription amount had been less!😒😣,4
Not easy to solve everything. Requires some brains.,5
Not actually challenging and a waste of my time,1
It's so difficult for me!,5
One of the best apps I have used,5
"Great, a bit expensive",5
Would love if brilliant introduced sales on premium version for long time free customers.,5
"The in-app purchases are REQUIRED to get past a very small set of sample activities, and consist of a $10/month subscription ($5 if you pay by the year). Uninstalling now. Might have recommended it to my students if I could have previewed it for curriculum alignment and its price were set such that I believed that the ones who need it would be willing to use it.",2
No need to say anything about this app !! It is awesome by its name !!,5
excellent app for students,5
Fun and addicting,4
Just Great,5
Being the president of the after school math club at our school I wanted to get an app that was challenging enough yet wasn't a full on extensive lesson that would take too long. The level of problems from this app are really perfect for this,5
I like to keep my mind turning in different ways.  This helps me think less creatively and more mathematicaly.  I really enjoy the different subjects,5
I hope this is fixed soon because I really like what I've seen so far and wish to continue.,3
I would like to be able to see more solutions for not seeing a few add though.,4
Was enjoying this for all of 3 days before the images disappeared making it impossible to play,2
"A great way to learn, or relearn, some maths / science etc.",4
I cannot scroll large questions to see the whole question.,4
Things we should know rather than the names of all the Kardashians. All for it.,5
I've used this for several days now and it is a great app if your looking to train your brain,5
Lame. Dont waste time. Cool. But who cares?,1
Great app to learn about everything and test your knowledge,5
Great Qs..fun solving them,5
Only one app that I rate five stars,5
Opportunity to connect with the world..,4
Way to expensive to fully unlock,3
Don't bother,1
Just awesome and logical questions,5
Wonderful passtime all around!,5
Charming way of teaching,5
Superb brain brush...,5
Really Brilliant!!!,5
Helps a lot,5
The title says it all...,5
Did full justice to the name,5
Funny,4
"Love this, much better use of time than flicking through Facebook etc, one issue is when I go to sign up for premium version my device says Google play has crashed on clicking on in app payment option... Running android 7 on Nexus 5X not sure if you can help",4
"Easy to use, and the teaching techniques used in the app are obviously designed to not only be different and stand out, but to really involve and teach the user about the subject! Amazing!",5
This app has great explanations for each exercise. I recommend this to anyone who is interest in practicing their math skills,5
"Interesting puzzles, and likely to learn plenty. However when given multiple choices the app only displays the radio buttons, but not the text.",2
"Fun game, gets you thinking. Only issue I have is you have to pay to get a majority of the categories.",4
Should have been totally free of cost to see solutions,4
Love a good scientific challenge every so often. This app is brilliant for that.,5
Thanks for providing us with the chance to stay smart and get even smarter ;),5
There r unique problems to solve nd refresh our mind,5
"Keeps the mind working, and I learn something new as well",5
New puzzles tickle your mind!,5
Great application!,5
Best app for questions and theory in maths,5
Difficult,5
If I didn't have RSI before registering I do now. Older adults are discriminated against by virtue of needing to give up due to exhaustion scrolling through every month individually between now and when they were born. I wonder if that gives a clue as to the quality of the content? I'm too exhausted to find out. Btw the advice given below didn't work on the S7.,2
If you want me to use this friggen app I don't have 5 minutes to flip to my birthday. What app developer uses that method dumb. Didn't even get to use the app...ain't nobody got time to flip that many times.,1
"I can't type in my birthday. I have to back the calendar one month at a time starting from January 1999, I would have to press the back button over 400 times to reach April 1965. Who ever thought of this in not very brilliant. Very poor app right from the beginning.",1
"One of the best educational apps I hav ever downloaded. Thanks for the team,for designing such a great app, hope you'll do better and keep going.i would be very happy if most of the topics were free...it helped me very much and I'm very thankfull to the team of brilliant for such a great app...",5
I would have given 5 stars if there was share problem feature... Why is it not available yet when we can actually post problems in the app by clicking the direct share problem link??,5
I really think this app is quite good although it does skip from very easy to insanely difficult at times. Also i think its good but not that good Id want to spend £8 a month - wow it's  probably the most expensive app ive seen.,3
V repetitive game.   Just a bunch of wordy questions.   Don't waste your time.,1
If you want something literally brain challenging just download and I promise itll be up to you to push yourself. Great app. Hope everyone else feels the same.,5
Basically wanting to charge a convince fee for lessons you can find online if you look hard enough. I'd rather look than pay.,2
It's interesting to see just how much you've remembered (or forgotten) about the background knowledge we use almost every day.,4
"I learn something new everyday, and am always welcomed to a difficult problem to work through but am encouraged to push myself and overcome it. Wonderful app",5
Loads of stuff to make you use your bonce-the difficulty level is well beyond most brain training apps-starts you off easy and gets progressively harder,5
"Common first question about geometry is already wrong,  use some geometry books before doing this",1
I'm not paying $5 or $10 a month to unlock everything. Ridiculously expensive.,3
The sums are AMAZING and STANDARD but the app is SLOW and when I want to save sums it don't work .,1
Wonderful way to learn about our world and all it entails. Well made app.,5
Great app but you have to pay for the explanations of the answers,3
"Good game to challenge your way of thinking, and putting perspective on problem solving!",5
It's awesome when you're curious about how things/ the world works,5
Really helps improve my mental agility and some of the stuff is useful to my GCSEs.,5
"Excellent app, the discussions for solution, which make the app what it is are incredibly expensive unfortunately.",4
This is a very good all for people who love good reasoning questions and fun maths!,5
Just love this.It gives some tricky problem to exercise the brain.,5
Has all the topics you will ever need to learn in life,5
"Super, excellent ,marvelous download it friends",4
Very helpful app to gain your knowledge.,5
Very good app to gain knowledge of every thing,5
It crashes when I wish to subscribe. :(,4
Takes a lot lot of money for unworthy!!🙅🙅,1
Tons to learn. Very well structured.,5
Great game but too expensive,1
This is the perfect app to pass time,5
Fundamental concept brilliantly cleared,5
really a brilliant thing for everyone!!,5
Best app for fun problems to solve,5
Really keeps my brain young,5
Great concept of learning,5
Great mind exercises,5
remember a lot from early school,5
Great love it,5
Very challenging,5
Hard,5
Mind games,4
Wow!...,5
Neuroplasticity,5
A++++,5
"I am really enjoying this app, but I am not able to buy for some reason (not eligible) Please fix this.",4
All in all this is a good app though I have encountered wrong answers. When I put in a correct answer it told me I was wrong and then proceeded to list out the reasons why I was right. This has left me rather confused.,4
"..more content should be free or somehow earnable. It's nice not having ads and pop ups in an app for once, though.",4
"Uninstalling this crap right now wants me to pay for solutions and even some quiz :@ You guys are spreading knowledge at front-end but are greedy from behind, ggwp I'll stay with KhanAcademy.",1
This app increased my interest towards the subject. Thank you BRILLIANT team. You people are amazing.,5
The only thing I don't like about this app is that it's not entirely free you should be able to get free brilliant ² when you reach a certain day streak or something,4
"Love the idea.  But phrasing in many of the problems gives way to interpretation issues, even though they THINK they are being specific.",3
Great app but it hangs a lot on my phone. The logic quizzes are really amazing.,3
"I think you really need to work on clarifying your questions, especially the ones with images.",2
Nice application to get general knowledge of daily routine activity,4
Great for strategy. The app even walks you through the thought process,5
Should have a trial mode instead of removal of solutions,2
I got the 1 solution wrong today. So a 5. God bless you.,5
"Nice questions, nice categories, good challenges :). Everything's awesome.",5
Lots of little puzzles to keep those neurons firing!,5
Loved the illustrations and very easy to understand.,5
best app ever used,5
Very good questions and puzzles,5
Interesting and engaging,4
This is just what I've been looking for!,5
"Challenging questions and problems, with sensible, detailed explanations of the answers. Much better use of downtime than playing some idiotic game. I'm learning a lot!",5
"I was recommended this by my math teacher, and it's so much fun because I love these quirky questions and everything that make you think. Definitely a good download for the intelligent type",5
"It has been great reawakening things i used to know, and even better learning some new things! I like that all the information is in easily digestible tidbits.",5
"When I started using this app,I think I have to thank my dad for recommdnding it to me.",4
Great problems and reference solutions are also available..Most topics are covered in Physics and Mathematics but not Chemistry,5
I've learned so much from this amazing app.,5
Very helpful in my career as a teacher!,5
You willnot regret using this app.,5
Best app for math lovers,5
just lovin it,5
New design is terrible. App icon is still too low-res to look good on my QHD display. Even nothing to solve now because everything requires premium :/,2
"About a year ago I bought the game Mind Trap and played it once with my friends and they wouldn't play with me anymore and I've been looking for people to play it with ever since,  but I have a feeling this is going to be a fun alternative.",5
Certainly more taxing than the vast majority of apps found in the Play Store. Highly recommended.,5
BEST WAY FOR TRAINING YOUR BRAIN.,5
Simply the best!,5
Interesting & Good exercises,5
"I love this app. It is an amazing, fun, and entertaining way to learn basic concepts of math, physics, etc., though I can not understand why Brilliant² is so pricey. $60 a year? Maybe a one-time $60 I would go for, but an annual $60 is silly to me. Oh well, besides the overpriced premium it's a great application!",4
It's brilliant 👍,5
One of the questions didn't show the multiply choice answers,3
But most of series are lcked,4
OwnedSome,5
"Love the variety of information covered. My only qualm is that so many exercises can only be unlocked with money. I would love to see alternate ways to unlock exercises, like by excelling at previous ones.",4
I've done two levels and the second didn't show answers in some of the questions,2
I can't log in through facebook. Kindly fix this.,2
Dam interesting questions,5
Really disappointed with this now.,1
Pay walls...,2
Besr,5
I'm not gonna pay 5 bucks a month for information I could get on Google for free.,1
I don't like the new interface.,4
Really Brilliant.,5
"The problems were done nicely, but half of the time they couldn't be answered. All the answers would be blank, and continued to stay blank even after a restart of the app. I only used the app for about 10 minutes, and my screen became hot to the touch. It's not the phone because I use it all the time, and it never over heats. I even got a system warning that said cooling down.",2
About an hour after installing this App I got spam about hook ups.  I now get around 10 a day.  I am normally careful with email addresses and used my work one. Which was a mistake ! I have not used that for any other site. So it can't be a coincidence! App is ok. But there is better and safer out there. Be warned,1
I use this app often and enjoy solving the problems but they are like the problems you solve at school/uni so maybe if you don't have much interest for the subject it won't appeal to you. Also there are no tutorials and the answers are paying so if you don't know how to solve certain problems you will need to do Internet searches,4
Have to create account to use this app. They will probably sell your information then make you pay to get the answers in the app. Don't waste your time. Uninstaller it immediately.,1
"Brilliant had an intriguing ad to bait installs. Took me through long install to be able to view content. After all the effort, content nowhere to be found.",2
"You only get some questions. In order to answer more , you pay. A lot.  Also, more than one of the ten questions I answered were poorly worded.",1
"I like to use it as a way to keep my brain challenged constantly, and use what I have, so I don't lose it. However, don't get cocky and start making me pay for a whole bunch of stuff.",5
Latest version when i press disscuss solution tab without entering any answer ..... And also find no solution in discuss solution tab ....then iam not able to even get the answer of the question......please fix it,2
I know it's for students but I love this app just for fun.  It beats Pokémon Go by a long shot.  I keep my CS/Logic skills sharp.,5
Happily surprised by the challenges this app has to offer. No issue with excessive or malfunctioning adds. Pretty great app to have in case your phone's away from service.,5
Boo! Way too many quizzes are reserved for Brilliant^2. The free version is more like a demo. I'm uninstalling.,3
I love this app. It let's you get reacquainted with math and science in a very fun and inventive way.,5
It's the great app. And I can play it all the time. This is for the mathematic lover.,5
We cannot see other people in the app and also cannot view there problems.. Could you please rectify this..,4
A wealth of learning at my fingertips. Great interface and tools for learning.,5
"The old problem has arrived again....i am not being able to save any problem...whenever i tap save, it shows a blank screen.",4
"Content :- great as always,  UI :- Very very bad",3
"Cool app but it is a shame you have to pay for answers, I think it would be better if you just had to watch a add.",5
It would be an amazing app if the cost for seeing the solutions wasn't so high.,3
Finally! a great app that gives you mind boggling puzzles! :D,5
"Seemed easy at first. But as you keep going, it challenges your brain to the next level.",5
Great place for anyone who loves maths. The quality of problems posted is excellent.,5
"Very nice,  very useful, only a few more features to replace my desktop",4
The presentation is great across the app. I really enjoy the logic puzzles!,5
Only get one free solution then have to pay,3
Generally puzzle games only increases the aptitude for that sort of game. This game is very general in its skill test.,5
Won't let me see why without paying.,1
I can comment on other people's solutions but there's no option for me to add a new one! Please fix that,4
How to find members in the latest version. Old version is superb than this version,4
It has become my favorite thing to be done in free time and it actually enhances your performance,5
"I love the questions, helps get my mind focused.",5
All for it aside from the monthly fees for answer solutions.,4
I'm preparing for uni and this is a great way to get your brain started in the morning,5
"Really good and enjoyable, content is being added all the time too",5
It is really a very very nice app. Must try.,5
Excellent maths app - best I've seen,5
Keeps mind active and Maths skills up to date,5
I wonder why i didn't discover this app earlier?,5
Answers aren't loading properly.,2
"It's hands down, a must get!",5
Way too many quizzes reservered for Brilliant2,1
"Damn, this app is good for improving math",5
Shows u ur weakness and strength in world of maths.,5
This is a deep-tissue massage for your brain,5
It's just an amazing app that I ever seen,5
But you need a pen and paper)),5
Just perfect!,5
Can't be moved to the SD card.,2
প্রত্যেক শিক্ষার্থীদের উচিৎ..... একবার হলেও Apps টা visit করা....।,5

"Despite many topics that can increase your knowledge and improve your logical skills, many questions are incorrect. It was frustrated at first, but then it just became ridiculous. The only surefire way to get a question right is if the question is too easy. And we can't view solutions to questions without paying a monthly fee? You cannot grow with this app! Ridiculous.",2
"This app is great. The objective questions can be solved by inspection without rigorous proof, but then the presented solutions are rigorous. This app made me realize some techniques of mathematics that I was not knowing. It also made me realize that not all formulas are to be derived at the time of using them. It trained me for competitive exams.",4
But needs some free solutions if the questions are too hard. Great job guys for giving useful questions for us to try out and improve our skills (at least). :),4
"Forces the user to pay to have any concepts explained in detail. It is not made with the purpose of users learning, it is made to make money. Use Khan Academy instead.",1
"Not every problem has not been vetted properly, and the ability to provide feedback is clunky and not always available.  Improve the UX and it might be fun.  Also, proof your problems.",2
This is one of the app which i think everyone must have in his/her phone inspite of he/she is student or not. Its brain app. Thank you brilliant team.,5
This game is very addictive and creats more fun when you play it in groups. Please make group play function so that in how much time how fast how many problems are solved is one of the great deciding factor for it.,5
"I've been missing algebra and other math problems for ages. Forget sudoku, this is way more fun!",5
Great fun app! Thought me lots of problem solving strategies and took my math to a whole new level!,5
The game would be cool if it didn't contradict itself and break it's own rules leading you to the wrong answer.,1
Excellent interface. Beautifully displayed equations. I have not found a single error anywhere. Brilliant product.,5
"Membership doesn't hold you back from learning a lot, I just wish membership was a little cheaper. Other than that, this app is awesome!",4
Only had this game installed for a few minutes and two of the questions wanted false answers.,1
"I am no where near capable of solving the majority of these pronlems, mainly because they are quite a bit challenging for the average joe.  In retrospect, this app inspires me to increase my intelligence!",5
Totally worth having. I play it every day so far. I try to play it when I'm tired or stressed.,4
The questions are really interesting.. people who love mathematics and logical reasoning can download it,5
"Some puzzles are OK, many are just boring textbook problems :/ on top of that, the app is aggressively pushing you to pay for ""premium"" access....",3
It plays the same questions and when there is more than one answer it only allows you to choose one,1
Great app.. Satisfied with the level of questions.,5
I love math and this is the first app I have found that really helps me review and learn more,4
Got to learn many new things.. It is very addictive too,5
Why does it want to know my school information and where I live and stuff?,4
much fine!! u must.. ✌👍👍,5
"Only one word can describe this app, Brilliant!",5
"Sucks that I don't have all the features of it, but that's how it is if I can't buy the app.",5
It's great I use it every day and ya I'm a nerd 🤓😥,5
Can't play a game that uses flawed logic,1
"Do you want to keep your brain at a top level, look, no more, download this.",5
Good content. Intriguing problems.,5
"Nice app, in free time u can use it as brain gym",5
Thismis onemof the best apps out there that I've seen so far,5
This game/ app really makes you think and keeps your mind sharp,5
The discussions allow you to understand anything you did not already know,5
"Have to pay to find out the solution, without alternative ways of earning it",2
great app! my best friend!,5
Very usefull to challenge the question to solv it,4
They make you sign up on fb/email,2
I am enjoying all the exercises in this app!,5
Excellent skills developing app...,5
It is brilliant in every sense of the word.,5
Truly amazing quizzis,5

"Was fun for a little bit but is aggrivating when the last question on a quiz you get wrong and don't have enough time to see the right answer because it moves on to the next quiz right away and there's no way to backup. Also, the amount they want to change you to see the solutions is bullshit. Uninstalling this garbage.",2
"The app is good. But sometimes it wont accept typed number answers and when attempting to report the problem the report system does not work. Besides that its pretty good. EDIT: The app claims ""answer needs to be a number"" even when everything written is a number. Written answers on the app are becoming a real pain in the ass as this means half of the problems cant be answered.",4
"This app is an easy 5 stars from me because not only is it entertaining, but it's a great way to keep your mind challenged whether you're in school or not. Plus, with the sheer diversity in problems, it's a great app to help diversify your intellectual strengths. With everything from word problems, solving for variables, or applying different mathematical/scientific laws, you will never find yourself getting bored of doing the same problems. Definitely recommended.",5
"There are many subjects that I am not familiar with, and the app gives example problems instead of an actual explanation of the subject matter. That said, it is by far the most challenging ""brain games"" type of app. There are many advanced mathematics and logic problems.",4
"The application is very entertaining, and also keeps your mind state active. Very helpful for students. I also like the little ""congrats you solved the problem!"" little confetti and stuff, very creative.",4
"Please improve it,previous version was far more better. Now I can't get more 5-6 problems in community section. I can't even add problems. Previously I had rated it 5. But now I'm Changing",3
"Never thought I would find the answers in this piece of garbage to be wrong. About half are legit, half of those are repeated, the other half give the wrong answer with a description for solving so unhelpful it gave my mom cancer",1
"Love this app... Has a vast amount of information and as a bonus, the user interface is slick and edgy too.",4
If you're someone who enjoys logic puzzles and  thing this app is very fun. I use it as a game 👍,5
"Great app, with diverse topics and interesting questions. Quite difficult in places, and I really appreciate that.",5
This app is really fun and requires brainstorming at times to answer... Which is a good thing btw.,5
I haven't had to do any sort of academic work since I graduated. Brilliant had actually got me addicting to solving problems and I as though I'm bettering myself.,5
"Uninstaling only because i hate when i need to log in, and when i press log in with facebook then i need to write my email and password, just taking my time this login stuff",1
It makes you think about math but if you are new to the concept you have to look it up or get brilliant2,4
"some of the questions aren't explained correctly and the ""correct"" answer isn't correct at all.",1
Some quizzes are a bit repetitive but it's very challenging. Wanted something to play while watching TV but ended up switching the TV off 😂,5
I can't believe this app isn't ultra popular. It has literally all of the knowledge I was looking for... 1/0,5
Great problems... Helpful discussion... Informative wiki pages.... All in one - Brilliant!,5
I like that there is a community to support you with solutions. I wish the pricing model had more gradations or was not so expensive.,4
They want accounts made and more and more info and before you ever get an answer,1
"If I download the app, it should be usable without giving you my email or Facebook info.",1
I loves this game. Gives me a challenge every day.,5
"Only get a few free quizzes, then it costs A LOT to keep going.",1
Gives very easy questions and then wants you to pay to get actual challenging ones.,1
"Definitely makes me think hard about the issue. I'm still wrong sometimes, but it's fun.",5
Absolutely amazing! The math problems are always a blast!,5
This app is really brilliant just like it's name says.,4
"I enjoy the brain stimulator however, I don't understand certain things. YET!!!!",5
For science and math lovers😍awesome game,5
Food for brain.  Excellent.  I am loving it.,5
"This app has many challenging mind exercises, spread across as many topics as logic, algebra, computer algorithms and more!",5
"Lots of fun, challenging math and logic problems and an active community that offers good discussion and solutions.",5
Enjoyable way to keep my mind occupied.,4
"Haven't done it, idiotic idea.",1
Very good. Even to just pass time.,4
"I love this geek game, bringing me to my school.",5
"This app is awesome , it provides a daily refreshing and mind bending questions and its just just just awesome , I love this application",5
"An amazing range of problems for all levels , and works perfectly well.",5
This site is really as its name brilliant for maths geeks and its applied ..thanks,5
"Very fun,challenging math game",4

It is an amazing app that challenges you and really makes you think,5
Great app with fantastic discussion forum...,5
"More logic games, please!",5
Very nice app to improve your intelligence,5
Fun way to pass some time.,5
"Needs chemistry questions, only takes you to the wiki with no questions, still in the process of adding them?",5
Old version looks better..,1
Serves the purpose of my daily stress busters,5
To access much of the content one must pay.,1
"If there is only one app to keep, it's this one.",5
Best for science stream students,5
One of the finest app.,5

This app gives a variety of challenging problems and improves our IQ to a great extent.,5
it's amazing apps...it's grow up your thinking power....and our brain.....,5
Also forcing me to create an account? Really?,2
It is helpful,5
greaat,5
"And pretty good for free users as well. However, much of the more advanced content ia locked to free users and solutions to (official) problems are not available to free users. Which would br fine if you could buy the app outright, but it's a subscription based model that is frankly too expensive.",3
"This app has earned its place in my phones for the rest of its lifetime. It's incredible as a source of information and development. There is a minor ""pay-to-play"" feel, but only if you're desperate for a solution; otherwise, it's been entirely free. Devs, thank you for being brilliant. My only qualm (which may be what attracts some people), is in the aesthetic; it feels like a rather bland, if deftly organized, classroom. Which, in one sense, is fine; however, it can leave more to be desired.",5
"With a great assortment of math-related problems and puzzles from a variety of difficulties, this app provides plenty of mental challenges. There are many topics to pick from, and there are also daily community problems. There are also built-in wikis for each topic as well as a comment section on each problem to get help and expand your knowledge. I definitely recommend this app for anyone who enjoys math!",5
You have to pay £7.00 a month to find the solution. In other words you have to pay £84.00 a year to actually learn anything you didn't already know!,1
I put in an answer. it said it was incorrect. so I used the see solution. and found out I had the answer correct. poorly programed especially given the name,2
I've been missing Mathematics so much. Thank you. I really enjoy it,5
It is very difficult to type and post solutions. Especially question. Need to coding.,2
This is quite a super cool app this is because they you can learn quite many things from this app this will help you to gain much knowledge and you will also enjoy with it please download this app .,5
"I'd pay for this app, I really like it. But I won't pay a subscription and that means losing out.",4
"I figure I'm a smart guy, but some of these puzzles baffle me. Intriguing.",5
Great to keep the mind sharp while on the bus. Throughly enjoying,5
"This is something cool and you guys out there should try it out, honestly...... Really love it....",5
"If you are a fan of math, science, logic this is your guy or gal for you.",5
Gets you thinking. A great way to avoid boredom,5
A must download for those looking for great maths problem Gk and others,5
Great mental exercise to help keep your mind sharp!,5
"I just love this app, Ankit Hatria..",5
It provides math theories and problems that makes you think,5
But why it's so expensive😞,3
Keeps my maths and technical knowledge sharp,5
It is a great app with loads of daily challenges,5
Colourful and great questions for learning,5
Gr8 for knowledge and educational means.,5
Great for math lovers,5
i am enjoying it a lot,5
Additive,5
Uh,5
"The name of this app is perfectly suited, because it is indeed brilliant. It covers such a large range of topics, with quizzes and theory. Every person serious about academics should have this app on their phone. Well done to the developers!!",5
"After compleeting the first guiz and trying to advance to something else the welcome message is guiding me how to start, and i can't proced to the next quiz.",3
Great app. Rather do this than play mindless freemium games like clash or farmville.,5
Finally a challenging app for brainy adults and kids. Wish I would have had this 20 years ago.,5
Brilliant app with plenty of free functionality. Suitably challenging questions,5
"Really challenging, great way to wake up in the morning. I just hate that there is a pro version of the app",4
It is a fun way to review basic math and advanced math. It's strangely addicting.,5
But you can go at your own pace. Ive found it seful for reviewing a lot of stuff I thought I'd forgotten.,5
Never seen an app as good as this.. Keep it up brilliant team,5
This will help me pass my exam! Thank you!!,5
A cool community + concise quizes and a reasonable price makes up for a great and stable app! keep up the great work!,5
I think this is the best of encouraging someone to doing technical problems of math and physics,5
Brilliant has been more helpful to me than most math textbooks I've studied on.,5
It's the cure for my abnormal learning appetite.,5
It's to much use for upgrade IQ & thinking power,5
It increase my brain for maths and physics.....,5
This app is excellent. I highly recommend it!,5

Nice game with usefull problems,5
The problems are really challenging me.,5
Is the title itself,5
So many funn challenges,5
Just hate rating,5
Amazing problems,5
Quality!,5
Can't add new problem from app.,3
"Its full of math that nobody ever learned. Since it doesnt actually teach you, it just expects you to know, it doesnt make you smart. If you want to feel stupid, this is the app for you. Nobody can explain properly how they get an answer, so if you get one wrong, good luck figuring it out. Its like showing up for a test that you didnt study for.",2
"Cera says, ""If it is raining, then I am at home.""  If Cera spoke the truth, then which of the following statements must be true?                                                         And not logically when i am home it is raining no that answer apparently is wrong.     No when i am not at home it is not raining is the correct answer,  i have had enough.",1
"Love the app. It's a lot of fun, but there are a lot of incorrect answers. The math areas are the most common areas for mistakes. Other than that, good game.",3
"Some questions are challenging and get you thinking but others don't make sense or are incorrect. You can't make up answers, especially when it comes to maths.",3
Nice... addicted with it too much..morning starts with solving 3 problems hahaha . But app is little hanging. Wish it will be make over soon,5
"Some logic questions only talk about part of the scenario, and they expect you to derive the answer from statements that do not exist and making it undefined, the need to fix these questions",2
I had an answer that made more sense and more logical than there's and obviously incorrect. Needs more work!,1
I just started and I've already seen multiple badly phrased questions and wrong answers that I've reported...,2
Why is the leaderboard available only in Brilliant² . We can't see how others are doing? I really don't like this.We also can't see the points of any problem.,5
I like it. I wish they would add a chalk board on the bottom for the mathematics questions.,4
"The application keeps on crashing and restarting every time ,since last update",3
Great app to improve skills...paid version a bit expensive though I think,4
Unusual way enhancing our intelligence. Well done!,5
Helps me a lot to kick start my logical and mathematical skills...,4
"It would be 5 stars, but the questions are recycled too often",4
"Lovely, Its like its name 'BRILLIANT' Reccomend this to everyone reading this😘",5
This is entirely best no ads no money just enjoy and learn new methods to learn maths,5
"The name says it all, sry Shakespeare!😃",5
It's got lots of great riddles and such that you really gotta think about,5
Brilliant way to brush up on school and find out new things with the wiki,5
It is a fantastic app to keep your knowledge and prowess at high levels,5
"Great learning app, helps with cognitive skills aswell",5
Makes my brain ache but it reminds you of how much you used to know.,5
Excellent practice for improving logical thinking and more.,5
"i love it, finally an community with highest IQ in the society",5
Helps to improve logic and has amazing puzzles,5
Go through it and you will experience.,5
I just love solving some problem.,5
This app is Brilliant! :D,5

Thanks for the brain gifts.,5
where people with the same interest meet,5
Very educational...,5
Best app.....,5
Really  brilliant,5
Good game,5
"Quite a few questions are either incorrect or worded wrong. There needs to be proper vetting of solutions. Also quizzes exit immediately not allowing you to view solutions, nor can you go back and view solutions.",2
If your going to have a quiz then have the right answers. I was sure I was right so googled the question and sure enough. I was right and this app was wrong. What is the point in this app if it doesn't have the right answers?,1
"I subscribed and I love it, for a measly ten dollars a month, I would highly suggest this to you. On a second note a shout out to the creators of this app it works well! Congratulations!",5
"Great app for improving attention to detail and analysis. Took me a while to find an app with these fun questions I USED to struggle with on ridiculous tests questions, like in iSTEP, SATs, or ASVABs.",5
An awesome app that teases your brain & will definitely make your brain sharp!  Plus it has easy to use interface & a progres tracking system.,5
This app is awsome! With a good range of diffculty in the questions. But  alot of the puzzles aren't available,4
"The issue I have is that if it happens you redo a mcq quiz, the questions do not change",5
Great app that turns learning math into a game.,5
Such a great free app that exercises your brain. Worth your time!,5
It is a wonderful app which offers learners to have thrills of maths and science...,4
When I get a problem wrong I don't fully understand how they got it right.,4
This app is very good for those whi would like to excel in their mathematics.,5
Awesome app. Keep up the good work!,5
Best app to rack your brain out everyday!!,5
This app is just best to test your scientific knowledge,5
If you are smart enough,5
Perfect app for math lovers,5
Fun and educational!,5
Really fun to do,5
Excellent..,5
"This app makes much more sense on a tablet. Please consider making the landscape tablet UI as well. A lot of Android tablets have aspect ratios close to 16:10, thus being rather tall and column-like. Using the app in the landscape orientation would be a far better experience.",3
"I thought I would find some interesting Math puzzles, but don't waste your time. This app is designed to make average people feel smart so that they'll stick around to make in-app purchases.",1
"even though I'm a young teenager, this is a great application! I can practice high level of mathematics, from algebra and calculus, my strong points, to geometry, my weak point, just about anywhere! and being able to talk to the community is also amazing! This app is, literally, brilliant!",5
"Fun and easy to use, jogs your memory on everything mathematical with daily reminders to keep you on track.. 🙌💞😏 love it!!",5
Best app on Google play...for math lovers. Please do it free.,5
There's so much to do and so many catagories. Get's really hard unless you really are brilliant. which I am not lol. Great app.,5
"Get it, very useful to keep a mind sharp. Only problem I have now is the ""problems of the day"" have stopped...",4
This is a great way to keep your math skills up or for students to study.,5
This is one of the best apps I've ever used. It keeps me sharp and refreshes what I learned in college.,5
But images never load to solve the question,1
Good app. For my daily brain stretching,5
Pretty good beside it's paid,4
The math is wrong on soooooo many levels,1
Lots of intriguing puzzles and questions.,5
Best app for practice,5
I could spend hours and hours on this app.,5
"I like this app because it has interesting quizzes and problems. But the sections can be too specific, e.g. I can't do a 'maths' or 'algebra' quiz. It has to be a specific section of algebra, which can be useful for some people, but others may enjoy being quizzed on more general topics!",5
I was surprised how good this app was. Great way for study.,5
I love math so this is an awesome app for anyone who wants to keep up with math or better themselves,5
This is a wonderful app for studying and just improving your knowledge about science related subjects.,5
"Fun game, good to pass by time and learn.",5
Awsome app. Keeps my mind working,5
Nice and fun,5
It is truly brilliant,5
An amazing app and community with a lot of challenging questions. Very useful for practicing on different topics.,4
"The app has a decent community and asks interesting questions to keep your mind fresh. That said it's missing some basic functionality, like viewing results and your current path in an obvious way. It needs to have a menu button and control on notification timings - I get some fairly useless notifications telling me at the end of the day I have a streak, but no notifications during the day to remind me to keep my current one going. Overall, its useful to stay fresh on topics from school and learn new ones",4
"Totally one of the best apps I have on my phone. One of my favorite time killer i just hope there's an offline version of the app but I know it's impossible. Really enjoyed playing, great community too.",4
I used to love maths and was quite good at it too. This game is helping me brush up on my old maths skills and I love that.,5
"Finally, challenging math problems. Not like the average ones you see in social media.",4
"Fun puzzles, but the pay to learn model is a detraction. You can look up the more common problem solutions on google.",3
Would be more interactive if a group of friends or two friends would be able compete each other.......,4
Interesting and varied enough to remain fun. The problems are also small enough that I can quit whenever I need to,5
Awesome to pass the time while jogging the mind. Building brain muscle.,5
"Great quizes, not worth the €4,50 a month.",3
"Excellent app, unlike dopamine exploiting games, this one is a constructive way to kill time when waiting.",5
Nice and though full app with good assignments,4
I use it when I'm waiting places to cut down on facebooking.,5
Great time killer while also being beneficial,5
"I love it, but there are some mistakes.",4
"Superb Challanges,Ultimate community...",5
Brilliant app to learn basic mathematics.,5
Great for staying sharp with math skills.,5
In order to learn and unlock all puzzles,1
Great app and community!,5
Best brain training game ever,5
Excellent brain game,5
Brilliance lies in Brilliant,5
Fun distraction,4
Good practice,4
really love it....,5
Superb ❤,5
Fun problems,5
10 stars!,5
:(,3
Me gustaría que la app esté en español.,5
This apps is very good,5
Good stuff!!,5
Great  app,5
Played the chess puzzles for an hour (59 minutes of that was one question). Eventually looked at the answer because I couldn't figure it out. The answer given was incorrect there is no answer. The second one I submitted the correct answer and was told I was incorrect. This app needs some serious improvement. I think it would be a great app if it gave the correct answer or questions that actually have an answer.,1
"Fantastic app, but the fact that I have to pay $10 to find out what I'm doing wrong is annoying (3 stars). However, this does encourage me to figure out the answers on my own (4 stars).",4
"I like this app but its not always correct, I have been playing for 15 minutes and have come across 2 questions that give the wrong answer.",3
"Nice interface, good content. Excellent work. Brilliant. (Lenny)",5
Too basic. It's just an app with a bunch of questions. Nothing exciting,2
"Seriously, you didn't have to give out my email for advertising. Please make money ethically",3
Gives me a boost of knowledge.. Loved it.. Keep it up.. Share the knowledge.. My most used app,5
Just wish you didnt have to pay for knowledge.. Kinda stupid.. But hey make yall money.,5
"The one issue I have is that I can never do the Problem of the Day. It always says come back tomorrow. Otherwise, I like the app.",4
Instead of admitting they are wrong or explaining themselves the staff just resolves issues and ignores users.,2
"Can't understand all the solutions, but that shows I need the app to learn more.",4
"Work perfectly on my phone, I have no complaints. Best brain teaser app on Google play",5
"Solid, especially for the free version. Considered buying, but don't think I'd stick to it long enough.",5
Eh 😒no levels or things work up to.,3
It's good and helpful in all aspects good and productive .... Keep up the good work.,4
"Just Awesome, I can practice my daily maths skill here to Sharp my intuitions and logic's.....",5
Just an issue. Favs are hard to find in the app.,4
.. No way am I paying £3.50 a month for solutions,4
Great app with challenging questions that always leave me wanting more!,5
"""It has become addiction for me, and I like such addictions.""",5
Fun to use your brain for a moment on your off time,5
I'm so glad this exists. I love this crap.,5
"Nice, fun and simple.",5
Good brain teaser app,5
Excellent app for preparing for competitive exams,5
Very Interesting app,5
Has Amazing questions,5
"Look, free problems.",5
Just incredible,5
Helpful in education,5
Sweet,5
Shot,2
"I like the challenges of the problems, but suck at mental math. My brain will never work like that. Would love to see a scratch pad of some sort implemented so I don't feel the need to carry a pen and paper to use this.",4
It's fun to challenge yourself.  Good free learning.  Love the app.,5
Solve the problems with intellectuals!!! Level of the questions r superb,5
"Same questions repeat every time, so not satisfied.",3
"Wanna have an active brain and be smart, then download it.",5
One of the best apps..the full version comes with a handy price,5
Helps review topics and to keep your mind churning.,5
"What for? Uninstall, unsubscribe... goodbye",1
Thought provoking.,5
And challenging,4
"Could have been a great app, but all the functionality costs money - a LOT of money. These developers aren't even charging a fair price because they currently have no competition on the Play Store. A month from now this app will be dead if they keep things as they are now.",1
"Why does everything need to be linked with online accounts? There's definitely no need for that here. Couple that with the problems other reviewers have been noting (pay to see solutions, can't post problems, etc) and you've got yourself this terrible thing. Waste of good dev time really.",1
The solutions for the problems of the day are great. But the one free solution I got with quizzes wasn't helpful. I want to improve my skills but I'm finding it hard to want to pay to do it when there are other sites who teach these concepts for free.,3
"Great concept, but you have to purchase in order to see the solutions. No point in downloading the free version if you are looking to brush up on your skills, you won't know why you were wrong or how to solve similar problems.",2
"Plenty of free stuff to make it worth it, but like all apps it isn't totally free if you want everything, though this it to be expected. Monthly subscriptions are irritating and that is what they have. I would definitely have payed a one time payment of $5, maybe even 10.",5
"Love the game, some really challenging questions but £3.50 per month is A LOT...I'd maybe be prepared to pay a one off but certainly not such a high subscription!",3
Its a great community but only  halfway decent as an app because it doesnt allow you to post problems and posting solutions is a nightmare.... make posting easier and allow us to put up problems and you've got yourselves a 5 star rating.,3
Too expensive to see a solution.. i had one wrong that asked what is 100 base 8 in decimal which is 64 but they have the answer as 8,3
I have a problem translating the question to my native language. It would be wonderful if there was a hebrew version/an example or explanation of the question.,4
"Hum, u can say best. For not only easy move but also its content.",5
"This is really helping me stay sharp! I am studying for the ACT test and looking for all the help I can get! Also, it's incredibly fun!",5
"It's a great app to test your knowledge of different topics, although only one set of questions per day seems a bit scarce.",4
Thank you soon much for fixing the problem from before! It's a really challenging game at times.,5
I like that the app reminders are actual questions that make me come back to answer more. Great app for practicing math and logic!,5
"This tests my knowledge a lot, and it's good for really applying things as well. And if I don't know something it allows me to learn about it which is good too",5
Very entertaining. Has a lot of puzzling questions. Could play for hours,5
Great app. Wouldv been an awsome app.  Sad that it ain't free and makes you go premium to view some  solutions,4
"Questions start easy, but get impossible - so good for all levels of skill",5
One of best apps out there for people who want to actively solve problems/ self-learn while interacting with a community of driven people who are always willing to help.,5
I enjoy the mental break that it offers. Both in regards to when i look for and only every once in a while it reminds me it is there.  The right dose for me.,5
The app misses many features when compared to the website... Please update...,4
Be prepared to pay if you want anything meaningful to come of this app. Then again this goes for nearly all apps.,2
"I would rate it 5 stars, but the subscription service on some quizzes I wanted to take made me drop a star.",4
"I liked it, but I'm really bothered that I can't see the solution for a problem unless I pay. But, fair enough.",4
Why have such a horrible price model? The app is genuinely too expensive...,2
"a too much useful app,bt too bad u have to pay 4 solutions..",4
This is pretty useful. You could even use it for refreshers on your license exams like electronics engineering board exam for me,5
"I'm in 7th grade, and do good in all of my classes, and this is awesome! :D",5
And second that we should be able to save wikis similar to saving problems!!!,4
"Wonderful app, I must say. Level 5 is awesome!",5
"Not going to elaborate, but it deserve a great rating because it serves me very well.",5
Best app facing challenging problems everyday really helps exercise the brain,5
This is a great app for people who are interested in science and want to improve there knoledge about solving problems,5
IT'S helpful app.good app for some tricks,4
"Awesome, but we need Arabic, please!",5
Great app for practice on various math topics.,5
get it if you desire to learn more about math,5
And you don't have to be a genius.,3
Really nice and helpful stuff here.,5
Bug/on Gal Note i717/4.0.4  :(,3

"Good exercise,guaranteed!",5
Excellent brain workout.,5
5/5 Awesome.,5
Great to reinforce your mathematical capabilities,5
It is really helpful and also challenging.Keep it up,5
Brings me back,5
Challenging tasks with wide scope of questions,5
Awesome app!!!,5
Please add more topics,5
I like the format and the asthetics to.,5
I love it!!!,5
Love the challenge,5
Wooooow,4
Too expensive!,3
Many challenging and tricky questions,5
Brillllliant**,5
As always,5
Oh yeah i like it.,5
Awesomw,5
"I would give five stars, everything in the app should be free of cost. Problems are really awesome and conceptual. Enjoy solving them alot! Thanks!, a great app though.",4
"The app has a great idea, however needs work. While the design is above average, the flow and mechanics of it could use work.  In addition, some of the logic puzzles (not many) are wrong and need revision.  In all, not bad.",3
"Brilliant has been a lot of fun to use. I have made several friends, and learned a lot more than I have ever learned in school. Would recommend to anyone who wants to have fun learning.",5
"I love it, but it's really annoying that you have to pay to see why that answer is correct. The app is only really useful for things you know.",5
Pretty good app.. you should let people know why is the answer correct more,4
"I would like to have the paid version but seeing as it's a monthly subscription type it's too much money, but the free version is good enough for a little brain exercise",4
"I like starting the morning like this, if it is possible, give this app an alarm that only stops unless you get the problem right. if you get it wrong it goes to another problem and continues that cycle.",5
But I wish it were free. $10 a month is pretty steep for something I can get free lessons elsewhere.,2
I like to practice my maths on a daily. Such a great tool,5
"Need monthly or yearly subscription in order to view the solution of the answer, how in the hell I would learn if I made a mistake then",1
I'd be more interested in your program if it costed less than $5/mo. But the free functions are still entertaining.,4
Absolutely love this app! It would be nice if there is a bookmark problem added so that i can keep track of where i am.,5
Needs a tutorial option so people can learn how to do some of the harder stuff,4
The limit on solutions for the free app limits the understanding from my mistakes.,3
Good but expected more articles on number theory which can be more helpful for computer science students.,5
"I love this app, gives you a challenge and wakes my brain up in the morning.",5
Unfortunately paying for answers is a little extreme.,3
The only math app available on app store which is so much useful.,5
This app is great! Very challenging.,5
Only thing is that the screenshots above are different than the actual app,5
Tons of interesting stuff.,5
it's challenging and a good time killer,5
Keeps me sharp,5
One of the best games,5

Make this free,5
"Dear Developer, if you do not have a set of problems for a particular field, please don't include it in the app. There is literally nothing in organic chemistry and other chemistry branches...Also, many blank fields can be observed. Pls make it a good App..i like it otherwise, hence 1 Star!",1
It's great at identifying patterns and making you come at problems differently but unless you have exceptionally strong math skills or a good memory you'll need a better review if you don't use complex math in everyday life. Also as a learning app I found it doesn't inclusivly take you through problems.,4
"Very good app for a high school student like me. The problems are not quite complicated, but help me review a lot of knowledge, especially in math and physics.",5
I love logic puzzles and math isn't too hard on my brain. Also being able to discuss answers with others if you don't understand helps you learn.,5
Brilliant is probably th app in which I spend more time every day It's full of challenges that will make you more fluent in the language of math,5
This is the best app for learning new things. Think!Think!Think!                        It's awesome...,5
I really enjoy this app I love to push myself constantly and this is greatfor challenging my brain on the quick seriously good job,5

"A simple yet great way to broaden one's horizon, simply by solving the problems based on his level while eliminating topic based constraints.",5
I love thos so much. Thank you :),5
Impressed with the feature of everyday problem. It keeps you glued with the app.,5
This simple app gives great daily practice solving examples. It's the perfect level of difficulty,5
Could be improved if there was easier interface but great site/app,4
Must have for those who want to keep sharp and exercise the mind. Who love logical thinking or mathematical challenges,5
Its a great app for interesting problems and solutions! I really love the logic puzzles!,5
Would give 5 if more free quizzes added,4
This app has a lot of fun stuff. Do not hesistate to save it in your smartphone (y),5
"Have only played a couple times, good refresher to stay sharp.",5
Good app .  The content is really accurate and correct!,5

"As a person with a math degree who is currently a stay-at-home mom, this app and the math community it supports is a fantastic resource for keeping my skills fresh for when I someday return to the workforce. The content is relevant and accurate, and the discussions of solutions so helpful! Thank you!",5
This app has some very challenging problems that really makes you think.  Not many problem solving apps do that as well as this one does.,4
Boredom killer app that helps me remember 8th to 10th grade math.,4
No need to describe...just name is enough :),5
"Really fun puzzles, I'm enjoying it.",5
"Relevant, helpful, user friendly.",5
Good app for student and teachers,5
This keeps my mind keen!,5
So cool!,5
No words to say --__--,5
Tests my brain,5
Really cool,5
"It basically has everything you need to know about math, and will really help students like me. The only thing I'd like for it to be able to do is to download the wikis for offline reviews.",5
"I wish it gave you a free solution a day, but if you don't get something right, you need to pay to get the answers. App functions well and doing it keeps you feeling sharp.",4
"It is a great app, both for fun and studying. Would recommend to add some lessons so people could get interested in problems on different subjects. Great work though!",4
Has many interesting problems and concepts. You can find the theory of some topics in there. A good app to have when you got waiting time.,5
Gave me the three angels problem and clearly able to be solved yet says not wnough info even though it was painstakingly obvious the answer was one,1
Good app but very much put off by the ridiculous charges to see solutions etc. I don't mind paying a month or two for the whole app forever but it's ludicrous to charge that much money for what this is.,2
Now quite satisfied with the New updates coming. Hope brilliant community explores more and more .,5
I really like this app a lot. Especially cause it has riddles and word problems,5
This is an amazing app if you love math! It's perfect thank you!,5
"When I use the ""join with Google"" option, it fails with a validation message saying that the birth date is required.",1
Daily dose of math. No complaints yet.,5
It contains very quality questions but there is a limit after few levels they ask for payment for solution.,4
"This is the app dat is better than any other educational app of its kind.Moreover the quizs,rankings,diversity is very nice and appreciable.👍",5
No more problems of the day since last update!,1
I like it. Nice brain warm up for me in the mornings,4
We can't ask questions which we don't know.,4
"Great math practice for challenging competitions like AMC, MAO, Mathcounts...",5
Keeps you in the know and you learn a lot in the process there's a range of topics to choose,5
It's awesome and keeps you brain moving.,5
It's nice  wonderful makes people more intellengent,5
"If you are into engineering, this is the bomb man",5

Pretty cool check it out,5
Nice way to spent time,5
Great app for improving technical abilities,5
I want the previous version back,5
Need I say more?,5
Puts your brain on rails,5
Superman app,5
"The quiz was pretty damn well prepared. The only downside was that I needed to pay but they got to earn them somewhere right. So it was fun trying the basic levels. After that, I had no clue where to go. There were many topics to choose from and I would recommend it.",4
"This app should be used in every classroom on this earth. Wish we had assistance in gramer school. Im just starting my higher education and have many questions like how & where to begin a persons journey of learning?( if any person views my  profile here and would like to becomes friends please feel free to contact me. I appreciate/respect all cultures. Bye for now, happy life to all.",5
"When i don't feel the rush to play video games, this is a good go to. Convenient app.",5
Questions shared by people (including me) are really mind blowing. It is worth spending time.,5
Really good and stay up to date. Not just the same problems over and over but different ones daily,5
You have to be a member to get the right answer.,3
Provide some very interesting and usefull problems.if we can't solve these problems we can view solution.,5
Awesome place for maths. (Y),4
Its an excellent application for mathematics.... Enjoyed it,4
It's a great app to share knowledge and learn new things...,5

Makes you think critically,5
brilliant  is definitly brilliant app,5
Great 👌,4
Great for students,5
Sickest app out,5
Muito bom,5
the app is really good but i would like to say something about the full version which people use on a web browser ( i didn't know where else to complain). the update sucks. it looked buch better and was more user friendly in the previous version. this new look is terrible. i would really appreciate if the old look was brought back and the options were brought back in the old state. thank you.,3
"I enjoy working on end of chapter questions from text books. This feels similar, however on my mobile device I can take the problems with me places. It's a great way to spark up old knowledge you haven't used in a good stretch.",5
A wonderful app but ridiculously over priced,4
Excel in maths fo real,5
Quite helpful,5
I don't really comment alot but tbus app really deserves it..It is beyond brain training..its a challenge we always looking for. Thank you guys,5
Love this app very much. Helps a lot on my studies. Lots of fun and absolutely recommended for those who like quizzes!,5
This is one nice app that will be enjoyed by all of you who like math! I strongly recommend it!,5
It's simply amazing app for learning. A good platform to discuss and share new ideas with each other.,5
Would be great if you removed the daily quota on the number of available problems.,5
Easy to get solutions,4
If you're not stressed enuff,5
Extremely nice app!,5
Just the app I was looking for :),5
It's Brilliant!!!!!,5
Get it,5
Just d apps i want,5
رااااائع,5
"Great way for me to flex my brain muscles. My only complaint is that the questions vary greatly in difficulty within different topics. Other than that, I'm thoroughly enjoying occupying my time on my phone with this game.",5
This has been a lot of fun for getting a mental workout a few times a day. An impressive stock of subjects and material. I highly recommend it for those that don't wish to spend their entire lives in front of a TV.,5
"I'm not one of those people who seem to think that everything should be free, but I do expect pricing information to be available BEFORE I download, install, and create an account (handing over personal information). Just put the pricing information in the app description.",2
"Please check the search option,when i click on filter and then all topics,the drop down menu doesnt appear,and also the stats section showing the points doesnt appear in the app",3
"Good app currently, though a few things would need to be worked on for it to live up to its name, a touch screen notepad would be very helpful for example",4
Very useful in providing support and study material for your school math as well as practice questions for competitive exams,5
i reeeaally like it .. but there's many puzzles got no logical answer,4
Im as dumb as stump...  but love this app.,5
...and a more than satisfying variety of puzzles updated daily!,5
It's stopped giving me new daily questions,1
Its an amazing app to improve my maths n evn othr subjects,5
Awesome app for time pass..I just love the app.,5
Good so the collage courses don't fade.,5
"Excellent app,I like it very much.",5
App has a lot of tricky problems but the solutions are not so good,5
A great app to build thinking skills.,5
This app helps to review your lessons .,5
Is there a better way to pass the time?,5
"Date picker font is white on a white background, can't select date of birth in API 22",5
I love this app so much.,5
Very very good for aptitude development,5
The best of @ll,5
Challenging but I like challenges,4
I'll pass every test,5
ভালো লেগেছে।,5
This is gd for students,4
Keeps the mind ticking over,5
Really awesome,5
Challenging and funny,5
But this app is brilliant,5
Keeps the brain in check.,5
Yeah,5
I like the variety of topics. I considered myself an expert on some math topics but have been completely cut short on some of the physics sections. I now have a long term goal to go high percentile on everything. The 3 daily exercises will take me there.,5
"I love this app. Superb variety if problems. I only wish you payed something like 15 or 20 for the full use of the app rather than monthly portions. I'd buy that straight away. Having said that, I am amused that the charge is €3.14",4
"Da bes gam app thingy, been playing cod bo 3 for days.",5
This book is very easy to use very helpful to us,4
This app gonna kill me...,4
Absolutely amazing game love it,5
Honestly love it😂,5
Good for maths lovers,5
"Just awesome. Amazing Mathematics problems, most of them a little challenging but worth to beauty of their resolutions. Totally worthy downloading, strongly recommended for Mathematics enthusiasts.",5
The categorisation and UI is good but not great. There is a major scope for improvement.,4
"Brilliant game! Haha, Great puzzle games and intellectually appealing.",5
"It's been over 20 years since I've been in a math class, so this is good practice.",5
The app is amazing but very expensive because it is a subscription based app.,4
Brilliant will vastly improve your intelligence and exercise your brain effectively!,5
Making ads instead of buying the app would be great,5
Muy buena aplicación! :D,5
I wish i could get a grade in life with this app,5
Notifications every day to annoying,2
Good way to sharping brain.,5
One damn cool app .,5
Keeps me sharp :-),5
Sad.,1
"Great practice even without the pay portion of the app. It is a little steep but good luck finding all these sub-levels of math,  with detailed explanations to the correct solutions. Perfect for test prep and for daily quiz items. Competitive with sub-math communities. Also, levels 1-5 of difficulty to select. I find myself doing math problems to pass time instead of reading, playing games, etc. Kinda made me start to enjoy math  - ""no _hit"" : )",5
"The community and problem sets are great! Conventional icons and interface would greatly improve this app. The ""hamburger"" icon should actually mean ""app settings"" to slide a drawer out from the left (instead of the three vertical dots). The circle icon second from the right to mean ""profile"" should actually just be the profile picture placed on the far right. ""Topics"", currently under the misused ""hamburger"" icon should be tucked away either under ""app settings"" or ""profile"". I could go on complaining...",3
"This is an unbelievably useful and educational app that combines mathematical knowledge with logical understanding and practicality. Use Brilliant for a month and expect to win every maths quiz, succeed in every maths exam and top every maths debate! (That is an exclamation mark.)",5
It keeps your brain going. Even if you dont pay for it there are plenty of questions to work through. It would be nice though if the price was a bit less.,4
I love this game. Such a test if Intelligence. The only issue is Pegi 3?  Some questions I don't think a 3 year old could answer!!,5
Its a nice app for maths lover.. Helps us come across questions posted by people across the globe.. Its just Brilliant! ;),5
If I'm going to give my email or social media information it better be an awesome app. They still pretend me to create an account before I ever know if I'm going to like it.,1
"One of the best apps that I have ever used grea UI, beautiful problems, elegant solutions interesting knowledge and much more only on brilliant. Org",5
I love the app. So far it's really good. It's like a private tutor but better. I can see my mistakes and improve for later on. It's better than some teachers that I have.,5
"However the sets from the other users that you save are not visible in the ""Saved Sets"" section. Please fix that!",4
I got this app purely because a friend was faster at mental math than I was. But now I really enjoy it.,5
It's really amazing tools  to learn maths. I personally learned a lot in very less time.,5
This is the perfect app for those who love problem solving... Many many thanks to the developers...,5
This is totally awesome which requires brainstorm. People who want to challenge your mind or natural philosophy lover should ever try this. Exactly what i need.,5
Loving this app because the premise of it is so comfortable for me; the math and logic puzzles are right up my alley and are really fun in my spare time!,5
This app is amazingly awesome. Don't miss it. Brilliant people become more brilliant.,5
But lacks a slick interface. The UI needs to be improved,4
Unable to payment. Card expiry date is up to 2024. My card expiry date is 09/33. How to pay?,5
i really love this site and i want to say a massage to other app makers that please make like this app so that the futures of the world our young children will be developed,5
It seems like a very good app. I just want them to keep updating it to make it better,4
It's very good for logical and mathematical tactics upgrade......... Trust me it will help a lot in preparation of entrance exams.....,5
The app is very well structured and truly is a storehouse of brilliance. Absolutely loved it!!,5
"Can't do much without purchasing, otherwise good",2
Game shines with brilliance and participation from others does nothing but amplify it. Great game,5
Would be 5 stars if I didn't have to pay for so many problems,4
Nice app. But too much restrictions in this free version.,5
"Great, but the reward when you complete a challenge is... stupid...",4
"Very nice app, it's the best way to give your mind a healthy diet and nutrients, really liked it!",5
But need more physics topics.... Especially modern physics,4
Great way to stay on top of your math skills,4
"The app helps to  improve mental skill,  aptitude, reasoning & mathematics . gudd app try it",5
"Brilliant app, keeps my technical knowledge revised!",5
The bad part is it's like spending your free time preparing for the SATs. But the weird part is that I love doing it.,5
There is no grade level to practice at your certain level.,2
Fun logic puzzles and mathematical questions are sure to boost your intelligence.,5
That's the app which give u a logical thinking for any kind of problem.,5
but better to give wiki for all topics,4
Best time pass. Helpful also :),5
I wish that the app was able to explain how to slove the problem in detail,4
Good fun for killing time and keeping an active brain.,5
Pardon the pun :) keeps me busy.,5
I greatly recommend this app to anyone who likes a quick puzzle!!!,5
Great for practicing linear logical thinking in the for of a game!,5
Although the number of questions required for streak is too little.,5
Helps the mind stay sharp. Use it or lose it.,5
Contains that type of question which help to broaden our thinking...!!,5
This app makes me more brilliant.,5
Its gd 2 to memorise  easy,3
I work better when im solving them on the toilet,5
Awesome way to get better at math!,5
"Challenging,  fun and ideas for teaching too",5
This app is a must to download especially for students.,5
The part with the solutions shouldn't be limited causes me to uninstall,1
Better waste of time than anything else!,5

Great way to keep your brain busy,5
Bisa buat belajar ilmu lanjutan.,5
It is awesome. There is a subject for everyone,5
Some great questions thr,5
only few topics yet!! :(,1
Cool idea,3
For all those who wish to succeed in competitive exams and for those who really want to learn maths and science THIS app is PERFECT..! It teaches you in a step by step way wherein every question comes as a new concept. I really loved it and I'd definitely recommend it to you.,5
Last year when I was still using the app. I availed a promo for a 1 year upgrade and there was nothing about anuto renewal policy stated. Now to my surprisebI was charged with brilliant subscription again! And no one from their support email is answering to my query,1
It will be even better if you integrate Facebook's comment section in  app's discuss solution section. It's frustrating not getting solutions of great questions.,4
Very cool app for math wizards.. Has a good interface too. So far I'm really enjoying this app..,4
Very interesting and educational. I remember all the things about math. But sometimes I cant see the solution unless we pay for that. Very pity I thought.,5
"This is a great app, designed well and has a huge range of problems. However, the business model of a subscription service doesn't suit the student demographic as people don't want to pay monthly. An upfront payment would be far better I think.",5
It's a perfect booster for brain and a very productive tool in the leisure and lazy times. It's one of the very good apps I have ever installed..!!!,5
Idk why i love this game. If it counts as a game lol. Keeps my mind fresh and i love challenges and love to learn,5
Haven't words. The best ever study app i used!,5
Would like a feature where I can ask a question without knowing the answer so I can get a solution.,4
Many people sharing their knowledge. In a pleasent place. Congratulations to the Creators.,5
The beginning is SUPER SIMPLE but you can get in to the real meat and potatoes of mathematics if you want and being able to discuss the principles behind the problem with a community of enthusiasts of different  educational backgrounds and levels of experience.,5
I enjoy the puzzles however I am rather disappointed that in order for me to challenge my mind I have to pay a monthly fee and subscribe.,3
Very gud. Gives routine exercise to ur brain! Must try!,5
Such a good game! Really makes you think!!,5
Not even able to creat an account...using any of your 4 options :I,1
Puzzled me with the sizzling questions. that make spark in my mind.....,5
Great forum for discussing seemingly ambiguous maths issues. Great exercise for reasoning.,5
I am unable to save a problem set even after trying multiple times,3
But a better (actual) calculator would be nice,4
"The old version was excellent, why have you changed it?",3
i would've given five if one could have submitted problems using the app.,4
"Older version had points, and anyone could view problems of any point level. The new version is crap!",5
Uses my brain rather than dulls it. Well done,5
now i can spend my time efficiently and have some fun ! 😍,5
I'm not even sure if I wanna use it half the time,4
Get to work in many applied problems.. Loved it!!,5
I wish there was more I could get without paying for it,4
Fantastic app help you to develop your mental abilities.,5
Excellent app with challenging and concept based problems best for brain charging.,5
It feels great when each chord of your brain vibrantly responds!!,5
Really great for people to exercise there brains out side of school,5
Wish there were more daily problems and instruction for solving theharder ones.,5
Just awesome app. Must download for a mathematics fan.,5
Eu realmente gosto do Briliant sempre trazendo problemas desafiadores.,5
Pretty good for brushing up your concepts on daily basis,5
In a word awesome app and tool,5
This was really fun and addictive app besides being educational,5
Wonderful app provides easy access to HOTS questions,5
It is a good app but it can be slow and some of the questions are difficult,5
It's very fun! Keeps me sharp,5
Liked it .. It will surely help me ...,5
"It's a cool app,,, and the mathematical problems are quite intellectual.....",5
Gets the simplest of answers wrong!.,2
Problems are food clarification and sequence of them is a bit odd..,5
Best for building maths basics thanks a lot,5
Community problems are interesting one.,4
really enjoy it    refreshing  my concepts,4

Kamran M Hussain,5
Makes brain thinking,5
Fbuln,5
For Maths lovers,5
"Like the challenge of the questions. But over half the app is blocked behind a monthly pay wall. Im fine with ads being in an app, but to put a pay wall in just isnt right. Will still use it while I can, but when Ive answered all the questions available to the free guys,  probably going to uninstall it.",3
"The game is fun however, I needed some billing help so I sent email to customer service. I have not gotten any response.",3
Trivial or asks for subscription. I am not convinced that subscription guarantees non trivial problems.  Disappointing demo. Also slow. Uninstall.,1
"I cannot edit the about me column, when I click edit it redirects me to the same page. If you fix this I'll give 5 stars.......",4
Its fun but you only get one solution to a problem and then you have to pay to get every single one after that. Bogus.,2
The theme and the content is really appreciable but the money matters here... It's worth it!,5
"Great app. I highly recommend it to anyone really. But especially to the mathematically minded individuals, scientists and engineers!",5
I don't like the fact that I have to pay a sum of money before I can upgrade to another level or view solutions to problems,3
$8 for a one month upgrade is beyond ridiculous. I'd be very surprised if ANYONE subscribed at that price.,3
"A very decent app to learn Maths, Physics and Reasoning and enhance your skills. Nice option for discussing problems, notes etc.",5
I don't like that you have to pay but this is a great website and an easy to use app.,4
Fun app if you like problem solving however the subscription fee turns me off a bit,4
I am preparing for my gre.. And this app helps me alot,5
Bugs me whenever I try to save questions but a good educational app.,3
Beside that app is really awesome it contains many intresting que and give challenges to the solve nyc app,4
"Lovely,I would give five stars ✨ when u unlock 🔓 my lessons please.",4
Don't waste your time on social media. Spend at least a half an hour everyday and you will become a geek!!!,5
Cannot open discuss the solutions please help!,2
Confidently!! I'll stick for hours doing problems!!! Great app!!,4
This app keeps you entertained while you exercise your mind.,5
I love it even English isn't my first language,5
Really interesting app....but some features are costly,5
Quizzes were half done each time I opened the app... Meh,2
Just as d name... Its BRILLIANT,5
Yes. A great way to pass some time.,5
Daily puzzles to get your mind going.,5
"The problems it publishes are great, really challenging and creative",5
Can't use the calculator. I can open it but can't type on it,2
Great logic answer,5
This is actually a really fun game,5
This app taught me alot,5
Favorite subject math!,5
Fun and mind challenging,5
Fun entertaining app,5
Interesting  👍,5
"Brilliant...,..",5
Must have app,5
Quite interesting,5
Just love it,5
Just loved it,5
A brilliant app,5
Delighted,5
Nice!!!,5
Really giving my brain a workout!,5
it just boosted me,5
"The subscription is ludicrous. Even at the ""discount rate"" of $4/month when you sign up for a year. Yes the ui is pretty and works well..but basic data graphing and reiterated math/logic questions is not worth me paying $48 a year minimum",2
"Look, I get paying for solutions if the person wants to cheat or whatever, but I want to understand why I got a question wrong, and how to arrive at the right answer. Give me an opt in for ads or something, because I'm typing this from a Moto G and I am neither able nor particularly inclined to fork over cash for the solutions. Seems pretty solid otherwise.",4
"This app does nothing but makes you a brilliant person. What I like is that, the questions asked in this app are usually great teasers. It makes your concepts more clear. This app may also improve your IQ level.                         But obvioulsy this app is for intelligent people, so those who find solving questions wasteful or not entertaining, this app is not for you. But otherwise this app is simply Brilliant.",5
I would give 5 stars except the programmer messed up and if you try to do 320÷4 you get 1280 instead of 80 and I decided to try and × it and u still get 1280. Fix your scratch paper and I'll rate 5 stars. Also very expensive to buy! It would also be nice if you would respond to your reviews and emails about feedback on your app.,4
I can't see how many points the question carries on my mobile. Also add the feature of adding a problem through the app ASAP,4
"No, not the name. The app is brilliant. The concept is fantastic and it keeps you sharp. Thank you",5
Thank you so much for sharing these incredibly interesting problems!! I've learnt and enjoyed a lot with this app,5
"Love the app, its been great at  getting my maths skills up to scratch. My only issue is that the subscription is far too expensive.",4
"Every day practice to keep a sharp mind, I dig it. Easy to hard problems get you thinking it's about time we got an app to help educate as easy as this one.",5
Actually has challenging questions! Most apps are too simple for my taste but this one is a keeper!,5
Very useful app..  Ultimate questions... ♥,5
Purchased brilliant2 on desktop but still doesn't carry over to mobile account. Useless,1
"It's quite fun to solve math problems here, my issues is just the subscription price kinda high for me",4
It wasn't fun like the ad that made me download it in the first place.,1
Good...  Bt it only works if u have a data pack or WIFI,4
This apps can make everyone have fun for solving problems at any levels...,4
"But, more languages... Please",5
Overall it is Gud...But it is asking Premium money for Far solutions,4
Its fun app to do something in part time,4
Pretty nice to use it when you wake up to mqke your brain running.,5
It's a good way to keep my brain working for the school break,5
"Yes, this is the best app ever for science and mathematics...",5
Make some physics app like this plz... Awesome app,5
I've learned much more about maths from this brilliant app!!,5
"Puzzles are great, gets you thinking.",5
The app works well and it's fun solving problems.,5
It's a good way to get thinking throughout the day,5
Please add the problem sharing feature to the app,4
Gets you thinking about something other than work!,5
"Challenging, but fun. Great app.",5
Just didn't like it.,2
A question a day keeps the mind from going astray !,5
Its a great way to practice during the summer,5
Great workout for the mind.,5
Excellent questions....some really tough,5
An easier way to improve intelligence.,5
Great for your thinking skills love it,5
Seems expensive for the service though,4
Helps me stay in shape and keeps my mind running in the math world,5
But limited questions,5
Lots of thing to learn.,5
I need practice,5
Tough questions,5
Challenges myself 👏👏,5
Thank you!,4
Money... Money..,3
Luve it,5
"I love this app because it teaches how many math problems works and not only how to solve them, this app helps you to understand, not just to know, this app increases your knowledge and understanding about math",5
You fixed it! Thank you so much! I can sign in flawlessly with Google now! :D,5
"The most recent versions removed a lot of good functionality, like being able to favorite problems/save them to a set, would be nice to see them come back",4
"Please upgrade the app so that we would be able to experience the same Brilliant in our Android how we experience it in our PC(s). Rest, all is good (Y).",5
"It's a great app . I love solving these kind of math , logic or physics problems in my free time . The most efficient way to spend extra time sharpening your brain.",5
The constant trolling for Brillian Squared is NOT conducive to becoming math proficient! Awful!,1
Very fun and brings me back to times where I was much smarter. Lol. Now I feel dumb as a brick. xP,5
This app is a great tool for sharpening/keeping math and logic skills!,5
"But there are some problems, solutions to which I find wrong...and there's no option to challenge it",4
Login error!!!! App says wrong credentials for logging in but a very great app,5
I tried sign up with Facebook and with Google and neither will work.,1
I love how it quizzes you on many subjects. No problem with this one,5
Really excellent..every math and phy lover should download this app...,5
"Whenever I'm looking for a way to strengthen my mind, Brilliant is my favorite app to use.",5
Better app ... Good for students.. I really like it..,5
Wondeful app. Gives a great insight into all my favourite areas of interest.,5
Perfect for testing your knowledge of maths.,5
It's just awesome,4
I just loved it. Especially the discussions,5
Two Thumbs Up!!!,5
Great puzzle app.,5
It's good for foundation purpose....,5

Mind boggling,5
It helps me to practicing myself more in maths thank u so much but this app has so many problem,3
Awsum awsum..prblm solving at its best...it real IS USEFUL..PLZ GUYZ install this rather than installing shitty games,5
Consists of a fairly comprehensive bank of questions to keep your grey cells active every day,5
This app is so good for mathematics lovers. I loved it so much.,5
Really good one to increase and sharp your mind... ready and get your mind brilliant,5
Unfortunately briliant has stopp...,1
Love it really great,5
very good...,5
I only played this for two days and deleted it. There were more than a few questions where the answer you were expected to give is an incorrect answer. There is no system to report these problems. Huge waste of time.,1
"8 or 9 questions in, I hit a wrong answer in their answer key. Stay away if you're looking for a tool to help you learn.",1
NYC app.....improves maths and physics.... Too helpful,5
App could be made from good to best. But the content is awesome.,4
"I was so excited for this app, even thought about buying it the first time it asked... So glad I chose to hold off. Multiple questions Ive gotten have had incorrect answers to them, and when I choose a category to do specifically, a few questions in I always end up answering questions from other categorys. Which is a little more than frustrating. Not to mention every few questions, I get asked to upgrade. Which really wouldnt be an issue if this app actually operated decently, but it doesnt.",1
"My excitement about the app quickly turned to disappointment when the second question I answered had an incorrect solution and said that I was wrong. This blatant error on a simple problem yanks the credibility right out from under the app.      Update: The day after I originally made this post, they corrected the error and gave me credit. Gave them back one star, but I can't give up the 5th when it wasn't right the first time. Still a great app. 4 stars is a decent score.",4
Hey the new update is really bad..I can't see the points of individual problems nor the comment box and report section is also missing.I had given 5 stars but this update doesn't deserve the 5..its really is dope.I request Calvin sir to release the previous app with its own original features.it was the best.anyways always a follower of the community.big fan.,1
OK so I get no more than 4 little sets to do before you ask me to upgrade. The are at least 20 others minimum and you can only give me 4 tops?! Stupid. ✌✌✌✌ Not dealing with this bullshit.,2
"Awesome app... really the best. But the new update sucks! No like, reshare, or add to set option. Also if accidently pressed discuss solution it won't ask for confirmation and won't allow me to answer. It freaks me out. Please dev fix these issues!!! BTW hats off for your work!!!",5
"Several questions have the wrong answers marked as correct: eg ""no"" is the real correct answer, they say ""yes"", and then the question's explanation proves "" no"".",1
"The moment I install & try to sign in, it displays the error - the app has stopped. Plz report' I've uninstalled & reinstalled cpl of times, but to no avail. No response FM the app support side either. Disappointed !",5
"Example Victor Rodriguez it's the sequence of numbers in the puzzle. 1st is April so it's 1&4, 2cd is May so it's 2&5, 3rd is June so it's 3&6, and the 4th is August because it's 4&8. Look at the numbers and think about it.",5
"A mother have 4 kids,  the name of the first is April,  the second is may, the third is June,  what the name of the fourth kid ? If you said July it's wrong, the answer is August, what the logic in this ???",5
"Pls add desktop options like reshare,   activity,  like a problem and save it offline. Even though it has so much missing I give 5 stars just for the community that brilliant has brought up....",5
It is a wonderful app.  I wish that the free app.  was not limited in the problems though.,5
It wont let me type in a fraction.... So i got most of them wrong,2
Clunky interface. Push notifications soooo annoying.,2
Its an amazing way to build your skills there are a lot of problems and its solution which can help u in any entrance exam of colleges and universities level ............,5
One has made better knowledge with the facts surrounding the being.,5
Great way to keep my head turned on during the summer,5
Really gets you thinking and some nice brain teaser. Recommend for anyone who likes a puzzle,5
It's a great app or I should say the best app for maths lover.,5
Must try if you love math,5
Best math app I've ever used,5
It makes r mind sharp & intelligent,5
Please add a french version!,3
"Gd,  love it",5
This game is fine and challenges you.,5
Did I really just see learnt on this app?,3
I usually play this game while on the toilet,5
Really helping me alot,5
Test your mind anywhere anytime ..  👍👍👍,5
Excellent refreshment,5
I just loved it,5
nice...,5
Amazing!!,5
"The latest update which changed the looks of the app is not good. I accidently pressed reveal solution to a problem and though there was no solution posted, it showed that i have seen the solution and so could not answer. This does not happen on the website and did not happen in the older version. Please check.",3
"It was weird at first, because the section titles didn't meet the practice problems. But, an update fixed that right up. Phenomenal app!",5
"Can't really be accused of false advertising - it's called Brilliant, and that's just what it is! I'd been looking for so long for a maths app aimed at more than just primary mathematics, so when my friend told me about this, I was beside myself. And I wasn't disappointed - proper head-scratcher puzzles that really do help you improve maths and reasoning. Thoroughly recommend it.",5
"I wish the problem would be shown at the top of the scatchpad. With longer equations, you have to jump back and forth to solve the problem. There is plenty of room for the equation on the screen.",4
I thought this would be good for me.  But it turns out this app sucks.  It did not help me learn it did not help me with anything.   I need to contact someone.  This is total crap.,1
The latest update isn't much user friendly. I am even unable to reply to someone's answer.,2
"I am a math person to the core, and not being in school anymore I find it hard to keep up with different problems, but this app allows me to have a mix of problems everyday to keep me on my toes!",5
The Name says it all... Loved it... Gym for the My Brain... Keep it up..,5
My only beef with this game is that it doesn't have an offline mode.,5
Love learning something new n refreshing my mind,5
Excellent quizzes plus always gives a question of the day which is awesome,5
Never loads....crashed all the time,1
"Brilliant is the only education app I've ever used diligently. Great ui, great concept. I've gotten stuck a few times and been sad when there was an unthorough solution, but those are the minority. More content, more study materials please. I would happily pay to have Brilliant replace a $100 Calc textbook.",5
"I am very much a Math/Science person so I found this as a refresher yet can get rather boring at times. I would love to exercise the right side of my brain. I can't believe I'm saying this but this needs English, grammar, and art questions to truly be perfect.",4
"So I go to do some word problems and they are so vague that I could have so many answers. Would give negative stars if possible. You are all the most idiotic ""brilliant"" people ever....",1
This update has ruined the app. It has made it slower. I am not able to view and edit my profile anymore.  EDIT: Yeah it's working fine now . But I still face some frame drops while scrolling . Hoping that you people  can fix that up too. will certainly give you 5 stars then.,5
"As a college student, I get bored and tired of the same old problems and just going over what I just learned.  I like the review and challenge of being tested on something I didn't just finish hearing a lecture on.  Bravo.  More Content please!!! :)",5
"Why do apps force you to log in through Facebook or Google crap...  I'm just want to try the app first.  If it like it, then maybe I'll link it...",1
On all the answers it required me to type the answer it would not bring my keyboard up... I am using standard keyboard that came with the device.,1
This is actually a decent app to start my mornings. Been routinely answering a set of question each day to warm up the brain 😆,5
It is a nice little app with questions. Haven't completely tried it yet but the experience till now is good,5
It's good for school kids aged between 12-16.. And a decent refresher course for others..,3
Some really good Questions! Go for it!! Great app.,5
STUPID..... My way of solving the problem works for me having it be wrong is not the correct answer,1
Don't think..Just download it and start solving...! ✌,5
This is a great app but incomplete as far as cohesiveness. Wish the notifications I receive would go along with the topic I am actually accessing.,4
Why i cant answer to all the question? I can't press the button of the answers,3
"One of the best apps in the market to  practice math for exam, olympiad & definitely for enthusiasm.",4
Good app for time pass and brain exercises.But sometime it lags.So Iwill give 4 stars.,4
It doesn't give enough information on too many problems.,2
This help me to solve problems! 5 stars! Haha!,5
"From simple quiz questions to mind rattling ones, this app has it all :')",5
I'm definitely gonna share this awesome app with my friends!,5
Great problems to refresh your mind and improve your  analytically and logical skills,5
It's Everything a math lover wants..,4
Great refresher for old studies and helps get you ready for new challenges.,5
"Instead of wasting time in jokes, chat and games,,, try this...",5
"Fun, reminds me how smart i am",5
Excellent app increase your stat day by day,5
I truly enjoy math!,5
I love doing these as I wake up.,5
Very nice keep it up!,5
I'm enjoying this app,5
Please add more science topics,5
We'll see how it goes.,2
But some Keybroad stick,5
I love mathematics and I love this app,5
Nice ..,5
Must try,5
Brain-gym,5
"As high school fades into the distance if my life, so do the finer details of the years of lessons.  Brilliant has helped me take stock of what skills I have lost and what ones just need a little fixing up. The exercises are great at getting my brain to work just a little harder in every question.",5
"Seems like it would be a cool app, but it constantly freezes and won't let me choose answers. It shows me the URLs of what it's trying to load or do in the middle of the app. Clearing data and powercycling don't help.",3
"And challenging... With this app, I stopped playing pass-time games and started doing math, I told my teachers about it, and they loved it, now everyday/everyweek my both math teachers solve a problem with the class!",5
A great app for math lovers. Enjoying and solving math problems.... :-),5
Low ratings are probably the people who can't get any answers right. Lol,5
Great for a mind work out and having some challenges. It has really helped me to remember things I had forgotten and to learn a few more.,5
A combination of whole math book.,4
"An incredible, helpfull and fun way to excel your math skills",5
Challenging way to keep your sklills sharp.,5
Add to the list of beautiful brain works,5
Amazing amazing place to learn and have fun,5
So fun!,5
Awesum... it is!!,5
Awesomeness is here,5
Brainxecise!,5
Can't wait until they add some more advanced math topics! Differential equations please!,5
Great way to feel less wasteful when wasting time. Wish free version would allow you to view solutions more frequently.,4
Great math app. Don't like the new update though,4
I dont like the fact that all these type of apps dont give free access to stats,3
Could be easier to use but not bad,3
Really kills time in a good way,5
Awesome app !,5
Best app..must try..,5
Wow!!!,5
"Fun app for sharpening the skills you already possess. Minor bugs still exist, but they're getting better. Currently the items on the home page show as a very narrow column. Not a big deal, the other pages are fine.",4
I attempted the computer science questions but had to stop because I couldn't scroll through the long numbers or strings without it swiping over to the next question. Scrolling through the long strings was almost impossible. Otherwise the exercises seemed fun and interesting.,3
"This app is definitely something you should check out. The lessons that they have are very to the point, making that each chapter takes ~10 minutes to finish, though you don't have to finish it in one go. It's nice to be able to just knock out a lesson or three while waiting in line, on the bus, or somewhere you would normally be making a bird flap through pipes. It is a freemium service, so to get data metrics you have to pay for a monthly subscription which they haven't quite sold me on.",5
"Math problems keep your mind sharp. No problems to report yet on the app. Only three quizzes in, though",4
"A really well made app. However, a lot of the time the app won't go past the loading screen. Would really like to use more!",3
This is a Hub of Good Problems from Maths n Science. Will keep ur mind vital. :),5
This app is really good for brushing up on math concepts.,5
I am very pleased with this app. It's nice to apply my good grades in high school to some mental activity,5

Awesome app... I just wish it had more variety of lessons,5
I just loved it.... it makes me focused in my free time.,5
"I've always been good at math, and, at first, it was really easy, but it has progressed to some harder stuff.",5

Extraordinary and brilliant,5
Addicted to problems of Maths and Physics of Brilliant,5
Name says it all.,5
"Some of the problems rely on slight differences of color perception to get the correct answer. Since approximately 2.7 million of the population are color deficient, I'd say you need to work on your app.",3
This is a great way to get some math practice. It has been a long time.,5
"Realizing how much I've forgotten, but it's fun to refresh myself",5
Wish you didn't have to pay for answers though...,5
It's sooooo expensive to get brilliant²,1
My favorite app. Period.,5
Well worth a download!,5
Ace for keeping the mind sharp,5
I love it because it is useful for my exams,5
Helps me study,5
Awesome tutorial,5
That's my kind of app !,5
The new MCQ interface is great! Waiting for material design...,5
A great app that offers the 'Brilliant' experience of challenging math problems in a mobile-friendly format.,5
Exactly what I've been looking for in years!  Simply brilliant!,5
Nce app...,4
The quizzes and solutions are great to keep up on engineering stuff from time to time. I wish I had the extra info that the subscription has but I'm not paying a monthly subscription.,5
Can't input answers or select anything. Not too brilliant.,2
Speaking as an Electrical Engineer. This has a guge catalog of topics. It's really nicely done.,5
Better than playing mindless games. I miss this stuff.,5
"It has glitch, after completing skill, sometime it shows at the end but sometime it didn't.",4
"Great game, much better use of free time than facebook hahahaha",5
"A crazy, mind-twisting and amazing app perfect for challenge finders.",5
Can you recommend Any equation editor/latex writer for android device,5
Wonderful way to test your problem solving skills.,5

Great app. Lots of problems and fun.,5
Very informative and great app,5
"Fun, easy to use and clever",5
Its aight,5
"This app is perfect for those who love to have their minds sharp at all times. I use it every morning to wake up my brain and, of course, as a revision of the maths I have done in the past. Several things I would like to see are some form of progress stats and visualisation and social media integration, so one can compete against friends' progress.",4
"Brilliant is an excellent source of interesting problems. Unfortunately the app appears to be an unwieldy mess and, crucially, keeps sending me unwanted notifications, which I can't turn off, even when all notification options are un-checked and even after I explicitly log out. Bad.",2
"A month monthly fee? For this? You are clearly extracting the urine from people, not surprising you can afford Facebook advertising at that price! Shame on you.......................... Update. And my inbox is s full of spam from you. You really are a disgrace.",1
Some very engaging topics. I can only hope they expand their subjects and elaborate on some of the more complicated lessons but the app itself is a wonderful idea. Keep it up guys.,5
"The home and community tabs are extremely laggy when scrolling. Please fix this soon, thanks! (Edit: thanks for fix!)",5
For all solutions you must pay monthly fee. Explanations don't give much understanding of solving. I suggest is best not to download at all,1
This apps makes a great alternative to games or e-books if you are trying to kill some time.,5
Whenever I solved one problem an link open automatically and I have to exit from this app,2
Used to use this app all the tine now it won open after updating dropping my rating,4
"I'm a math major, and this app helps me keep the wheels greased and turning, even when I'm not in class or studying.",5
"As a manager with so much going around, the puzzles and problems here really help me to blow off steam.",5
Good app but high battery consumption,4
We get to know about different problem from all over the world,5
Its a best app for preparation of my exams and for other competitive exams also.........,5
I love it and use it before going to bed.,5
Does not support  multi window feature  in s3 neo.........,4
It a very good app,5
☆☆☆☆☆ 5Star rating if unpaid...,4
Vipin yadav,5
So far it has worked well.  It offers a wide range of math problems from basic through calculus.  Only complaint they really push upgrading to their premium account.,5
Never imagined such a great app. Very enjoyable n useful. Please launch for IOS too. Scratch pad works now!!,5
"This is very good, taking me to all corners of math it is a great help thank you so much for this app",5

Awesooooooooome application with amazing problems with a network of worldwide prodigies !!,5
So brilliant as its name.,5
Lots  of bugs  please fix it,4
Funucation,5
Dear brilliant...... the app is bug free and it is very useful   but.... Since the KitKat menu has a white background your app's logo is not seen clearly... So I request u to do some background corrections to ur logo so that it'll be visible..... Hi fi guys.........,4
App is very heavy.,4
"The app has a serious bug,when I'm hovering over pages suddenly the Brilliant banner,(which is shown in initial launching of the app)comes up and remains until and unless i close the app..",3
This app is very helpful for my math class.,5
"I'm taking Calculus II in college. Trigonometry is so important in that course and you're expected to remember all of it. For me, I remembered about 35% of my trig until I found this app. Now if I forget a concept on my homework, I have this handy reference by my side!",5
"I really enjoy this app but, when it comes to multiple choice questions I wish there was a submit button because I tapped my screen to stop it from timing out and clicked an answer by accident. So I got the question wrong and was not all too enthused.",4
I believe khan academy is much better and it's also free. But they don't have their own app. This will have to suffice while I'm mobile. As far as apps go its one of the better ones.,4
I love games like Quiz Up and Trivia Crack and this one is like an all math variant that really challenges the brain.,5
This app is really awesome.. I was in touch with briliant earlier as well but after this app.... whoa.. I am way too addicted...,5
An option to keep the screen from going out while reading a problem would be nice.,4
Very lucky to have it as android app on mobile too &lt;3,5

I found this app very resourceful as well as fun. I highly recommend it.,5
Perfect for number crunchers!,5
Very good application,5
"Will often freeze and sometimes wont let you save problems. Also, after solving one, if you dismiss ""the next problem"" pop up and instead take a look at how others solved it, there's no way of proceeding, thus forcing the user to go back to the ""problems"" page. It's very slow as well, handling content loading as if it were actually converting the problem's webpage, which gets annoying quickly and shows that, even though the interface is mobile friendly - light and reasonably intuitive - the speed is not.",3
'solve more like this' on top hides my current question and it just dont goes away. It just wont let me see my question and I am not able to solve it. Fix this problem and I will rate it 5 stars,3
"Great app and love it but...it'll be better if there's a landscape mode and more payment options for Google wallet, like I can't get brilliant^2 cause I live in Singapore and can't really subscribe. 5 stars if all problems resolved :)",3
"Most of the features like unlocking the answers are in brilliant square, so cannot get the solutions :( otherwise great!",4
"Like duolingo for mathematics. Would be even better if it had more STEM modules than just mechanics (chemistry please! ), but basically brilliant.",5
I love the concept and the way it's worked! Would love to see more of it with further variety! Good stuff. :),5
Actually I love this site and this app really has a nice UX/UI. Its fun using this app....whenever I get free time I start solving problems over it...:),5
"App is good, but once u download this app and not use it for awhile they will keep emailing u thats very annoying,why the maker thinks once app is downloaded one should use it around the clock.apps is for entertainment not a basic need.",1
App is really interest flourishing but interface isn't that simple as it ought to be... Plz fix.,3
I would use this instead of the site if it wasn't in forced portrait mode. Make the ui rotate.,3
I was once a math olympiad contestant.. This app teaches me a lot..,5
Thanks for fixing the bug....  Best app ever,5
"Like a worldwide textbook, making you solve it daily and with more enthusiasm each day, as they say,..... KEEP THE STREAK ALIVE !!",5
"I've been waiting for this for a long time. It helps me very much, better if it's free.",5

"Why do I have to give my email ID or Facebook details to use the app. I wish I could give less than 1 star, but since it is the minimum, that's what I'm giving. I promptly uninstalled this garbage seeing that. Mostly only advertising and marketing apps make fb or email login mandatory. So stay away. Most of the reviews are also one word so this app seems to be fake, pointless and useless.",1

"The app is almost unusable on a tablet due to very small fonts. Phone's fonts are better, but still uncomfortable. Please, make it possible to change font size. I simply don't understand why devs so obsessed with small fonts. Also it'll be nice to have an easy access to popular problems of the day.",3

Well the app is undoubtedly a good one. But the user interface needs to be a bit more simpler. Easily accessible. A lil change in ambience of the app. Also a lil change in Blend of Colours would also be fine.,4
"Even connected to the internet, app shows offline and no help with the refresh too. Tried with different network connections but no help. Sometimes it seems like the page gets open but then somehow redirected to this offline summary page. Plz fix the bug.",1
This app is awesome . It is faster & loads pages better.  I would have rated it 5 stars but I have a request . Please add a practice option too for practicing various skills.  Please fix this & I assure you that I would rate the app 5 .,5

My favourite app.,5
So love this app :*,5
Extraordinary app,5
Was waiting since long....fr the app...,5
A reason to turn my phone on.,5
"I am pretty disappointed with the app after spending nearly $100 on a 
yearly subscription. This app does teach you some things, but it doesn't 
actually teach. For each course, it is the quizzes that try to teach you. I 
personally disagree with this method. Despite the fact that the app tell 
you that you don't need prior knowledge for some of these courses, you 
actually do. The app technically doesn't teach you anything. You have to 
learn it all by yourself through quizzes. The best example I have to offer 
is the computer science quizzes. It clearly states before you start that 
you don't need any computer knowledge. However it expects you to be able to 
read python.",3
"I did not fing this app emjoyable. Things I'm  thought would be logic puzzels are in actuality math equations. Not puzzels in the way the app advertisements made it seem. Nor were the examples giving availible without paying a monthly fee. Thats right a MONTHLY fee. 5$/12$ a month is unacceptable. Some people might find this app fun, but there are much better ways to spend 12$.",2
"I like the concept, but not the implementation. Free content is very 
limited, and can be worked through in no time. The paid content is far too 
expensive for what it is. There are weekly quizzes, put together from 
community content. However, these often feel like a metaphorical pissing 
match for people to say ""look how clever I am to have come up with this 
question.""",2
"Sigh! Don't get it, 1. they charge too much, 2. they dont even explain how 
they get the answers good, it leaves you with more questions and for an app 
that you pay so much money it need's to do better, i'm still forced to 
search how the problem was solved. Last but not least they charge you all 
at once so if you dont like the app it doesnt matter because you cant get 
your money back, I really wanted to like it and kept going back but im done 
with it, its to frustrating.",1
"Did not try the app, but wanted to see how it worked. The video link provided on the app's Play page doesn't work, so I downloaded the app, only to find that I would have to create/use a login, just to see what the app does. Not worth giving out my personal info just to see what it does, so I uninstalled it.",2
The older version was quite good but this one is not so. It is really different from the older one. There is no place to comment the solution also I answered the questions correctly and after that I decided to take a look at the solution it showed my answer incorrect. It showed the message that you viewed the answer. Also in older version the points of each question were displaced on the top but now there is nothing like that. For older version   5 stars.,1
"In general, a fun source of head scratchers, even if the ""right answer"" is occasionally wrong (but hey, less often than I am!)  That python editor is painful to use! Many issues. Hitting shift erases a character, no functional copy paste, just ugh. Most recently, the script output doesn't show up  anywhere. Bit of a Helen Keller situation there! The fact that it exists at all is kind of cool.",3
"I apologize to this app's developers! I originally gave it one star and a bad review based on a problem/solution that I didn't agree with (turns out I was right in the problem I was solving, but not in the problem they were asking). Also these guys will quickly try and fix any issues you may think you have with this app!!! Again my apologies, this is a really good app and the crew behind it is good to go too!!!",1
The questions do not have enough information most of the time and when you want to see how they found out their answer you need to pay money for it. Why would I pay for you guys to tell me how you got something? The one free solution was not even true. The questions are 50% incorrect to their own answers.,1
"Would be 5 stars if it wasn't so absurdly expensive :( I would pay a one time fee of $10 but that's as much as I think is reasonable to ask. This is a mobile app and most if not all of this content is available for free online. So basically, you want us to pay $20/month or whatever just for the layout of this information? very steep.",2
"There are good questions but lost interest quickly, especially as there are only a few quizzes available for non spenders.  This would have been fine as I decided I did not want to keep using it anyways, however, I am already sick of seeing the ridiculous amount of emails for it.  I deleted it, please quit emailing me.",2
"The concept is great and you can solve the problems for free but if you want to check a solution for a problem you can't solve, its gonna cost a monthly fee... total waist of time. I would never pay for something I can get for free. Total rip off. Uninstall",1
Great tool for me as a Maths major to enhance my skills in solving problems. I could also learn new topics that we never tackled before. Thank you for creating this useful application! More power to the creator and staffs! ❤❤❤,4
"Yes , alright it may be "" educational "" but who wants to work out maths and physics questions in their spare time?  and the QUESTIONS!!! you'd have to be a flipping physics teacher to understand it, especially when the explanations are a mile long.                      Oh , and who in the WORLD, would want to know how a TOILET works.",1
"I always loved the website. This app has roughly all its features and is 
easier to access. I love the questions and the ways in which people solve 
it offer great insight into traditional as well as non conventional methods 
of problem solving. Thank you. I just fell in love with your presentation 
and with maths as well. Science is something I always loved...",5
"Every time I tried to close a popup (way too many) this app registered it as a response to a quiz question. I don't know how tapping once on an x could be interpreted as '45,'  but that was the last straw.",1
"I gave it 5 star though I had a small problem with it. I am from India. I have had amazing solutions for few of the problems which I really want to share, but most of them need pictures to explain. I mostly use my phone to do problems. So it would be awesome if you could make the pictures creation thing on the app as well. Thank you. Hope you take my request into consideration.",5
Starts off well but then won't let you progress unless you pay for the game. Which I'm not against but don't pass it off as free and then try and charge halfway through. Suffice to say I deleted it.,1
First of all you're not getting my personal e-mail address and second  My education level is something that I consider personal and private. Asking for those is extremely offensive especially when I already signed up with facebook. I think that you are recruiting information about people for the government's use against it's citizens,1
It's a great app if you want to revise or go in depth in maths and science. It would be better if they updated their astronomy section and add a quantum physics topic. Learning loads and I definitely dont regret getting the year long subscription!,5
"For the first day it was great as if you get a question wrong you can view the solution, then on the next day you hit a paywall... £3.50/month just to see why your answer was incorrect!? I think not.",2
"It would be great if there was a 7 day trial or something. Other than that the UI is good, I didn't encounter any bugs and the beginner problems (only ones I tried, there's a paywall) are interesting.",3
"Tired of all these apps that ""require"" all my personal info and device access! What the heck would an app need access to my contacts, birthday, email, and full name for?",1
"I guess it was ok, pushed me to use my brain and see circles in new ways. But every day i get a notification that im on fire... And then i saw they also sent me an email to that effect so i was like, uninstall! Leave me alone!",3
"the app concept is awesome, but if you're willing to learn and you're not 
willing to pay monthly it's pretty useless. Maybe they could give you at 
least a couple of free explanations everyday",2
Simply brilliant. Amazing frame and easy to understand topics. The UI is user friendly. The methodology that is used in the app is totally flawless. It encourages us to solve problems daily. Loved it .,5
So basic. And just like most free apps always giving just enough free stuff that you get frustrated when the premium pop up tries to take your money.  I'll keep it but I wouldn't suggest it to friends.,2
"This is just an intro to a paid game.  If you want something more advanced than ""is the famous liar's paradox a paradox?"" you have to buy a second game.",1
"This app could be good but it requires you to buy solutions and has far too many in-app purchases. I'm disgusted. I was looking forward to a great app, not a ""pay to play"".",1
Loved it. Hub of great mathematicians. Well on my previous id I have cleared many levels. Now again have to start from the first. That's a sad part 😏,5
"I am disappointed because it is not entirely free, just when I was already 
enjoying it and planned to go for a new challenges other than logic. It 
turned out that you need an upgrade. I just have to uninstall it. Too bad I 
like the app already.",4
When I first played the app it was fun but after you finish the 3 quizzes they make you have to pay to go to the next quiz and sure you have daily questions you can answer its all pretty advanced stuff and some not so advanced stuff its all a scam.,1
The answer to the quizzes is too simplified. For a beginner like me its hard too understand the work that you guys skipped. I hope the answer in some of the quizzes would be more detail because im lost sometimes,5
"The question that attacked me to the app was creative. The first question I got was supper easy the second had blank answers, and the third did not have enough info to answer so I un installed.",2
"I get that you don't want people to go through the ""see and estimate"" logic, but when you make a supposedly 60 degrees angle look like a 100 degrees angle, that's way off. Sorry, but there's a lot of those kinds of inaccuracies.",1
"When i installed it it says p3 when I went to sign in, it wouldnt let me 
because Im not over the age of 16. All I wanted to do was get better at 
maths. All I learnt was rejectione.",1
The app was like a revision from my engineering days. The various topics covered are from different fields and the fa that a quiz is limited to 5 question doesn't let monotony set in. It was both refreshing and fun!!,5
It's good but most of the topics are not free. I'm from Bangladesh and those costs are too much for me. Education should be free or at least cheap you know,2
The fantastic thing about this app is the leveling system. Level 1 and 2 typically are good for review and often are the type of problems you find in school. Levels 3-5 however rely on the application of techniques found in easier problems in a more creative and intellectually demanding manner. These problems typically test understanding above the recalling of equations. Very useful for those who eventually wish to go into hard sciences (like me).,5
Simply Uninstalled. I won't tell you why or give you any kind of solution unless you pay a stupid amount for an in app purchase however. Much like this app actually.,1
"Didn't do much beyond see of the physics questions, answers were not all correct/entirely correct. Not worth the thinking time.",2
"El contenido está muy bien, pero el precio... Excesivo. Debería haber un plan mensual por lo menos. Los retos antes eran semanales y creo que tenían más dificultad que los actuales que son diarios, aun así es divertido hacerlos y entrenas un poco el cerebro. Se deberían plantear diferentes tipos de suscripción.",3
"Nice,keep up the good work. Pls recommend me smt for medical student. Thanks guys",5
I can get math problems for free anywhere on the internet. Interesting concept but the cost does not make sense for the service provided.,1
"This app is good, but sometimes the question doesn't appear or keep blinking and the solution can't be view for free. Please fix it.",4
Shock how much they want to be paid to play this game.yet no mention of any charges  untill u download it. Rip off is an understatement,2
"It makes math and science easy and enjoyable ...,  best part it make you chalenge urselves..... Best educational app ever seen..",5
Great for puzzles but you need to pay to see your progress. Beware though there's no way to close your account if you just want to try it out.,1
"This app is full of bugs and errors. Can't get access to the 'community' page. Now, I have to resort to my browser to get access to the site.",1
"Like every other good learning app, they stick to much behind a paywall. I'd rather watch a 30s ad for a 10 min session than pay $20/month",2
"Even though it is a nice app, can you tell me what is the urgent need that we can't used it without signing in??? I think so that you must make it full offline",2
"This was very challenging, although it's level 5 was the maximum level for each topic but can you reach level 5?? The question in this app is from easy to the extreme hard!! Like i said EXTREME HARD!!",5
"I don't enjoy the fact that with some of the educational apps you have to pay to continue forward, not just once or twice, but on a reccurring basis. I'd rather pay $5-$10 for an app like this.",1
Earlier i gave 5 stars... but when i compared the app with brilliant's webpage on brower.... that webpage seemed to be better than the app and I can't even save the problems in app which i really dislike... so pls work on it... and improve app ...,3
Good  challenging app but why sometimes questions are free but answers are not. If I can't solve a problem I sometimes can't view the solution.But I like this app.,4
This app is legendary. But I'm a kid and I don't have money and my parants won't give me some.jajak Allah Khair I love you Brilliant. 🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡,5
Excellent logic/math/coding tool. You learn the material much faster than you could teach yourself without it.,5
Nice... Nice concept developers... A lot of appreciation. But can also be improve by adding some virtual practicles.,3
"Great tool for keeping your mind engaged, lots of fun and really gets you 
out of your comfort zone. Great app!",5
"It's not really free since most of the levels you have to pay for. It's 
basically a demo. So it's a huge waste of my time. Otherwise great.",1
"Well, this is one of the worst apps I've ever seen. Stupid questions with ""too easy"" answers.",1
"Choose the wrong answer, you'll be told its wrong and asked to move on. You can only check how and where you went wrong if you pay.",1
Some logic questions had more than one answer. There should me more options to see a solution,2
"Great app to test on all knowledge but I felt the subscription that is needed for solution is a little disappointing. Nevertheless, it makes you spare some time to think.",4
"Questions not properly arranged , very slow and lags quite a few times. And got unwanted notifications and emails.",1
Great app.  It is challenging and thought provoking.  The down fall is having to pay a subscription for solutions.  Now the consumer. How Brilliant are you?  Brilliant enough to uninstall this app?,2
Learning something new every day is made much easier thanks to this app. keep up the good work!,5
Easy to use and a nice interface. A subscription is required to get such niceties as more sophisticated questions and an in app calculator though.,3
"I loved the app at first.But after the updates the app has really deteriorated. While the level of the questions is good, the app is horrible",1
Awesome App...Loved it the sec I downloaded it.....Great for testing your knowledge other than exams....Also great for aptitude testing......Although I would suggest giving a 30 days trial once downloading cause the user may feel dissatisfied after all he has downloaded a app tried to check his knowledge and then guess what... He got to pay..... So devs... You gettin what I am saying???,5
It is better than any game on my phone. I solve problems after I wake up to prepare my brain cells for the day.,5
"This isn't such a brilliant app with how expensive it is per month, and so it doesn't offer much when I can find all this info free online, or better yet take a class.",2
Very nice app but the app doesn't show full question many a times and so one can't guess the answer,4
Kept crashing and freezing when trying to answer questions. Also if tried to answer questions it would select the answer below the option you press.,1
This is one of the most fun activity to do..problems are great..i like to discuss problems with my students before we start class..this app really is brilliant....thanks..,5
Can't afford the subscription so it's not worth my time. When I tried to delete the account it messed up my phone and I had to restart it and delete the app.,1
"Deactivated after 1 month, but still being billed 8 months on, all means of contact ignored, will have get my bank to claim this back!!",1
"Not gonna lie, I enjoyed taking the first quiz but was completely disappointed when seeing all the other subjects were behind a pay wall.",1
What about the easy probs you show on pictures? Lags a lot and changes my answers. Screw it,1
It is supposed to be a tool for you to learn something and instead of pay to play you pay to learn. Not free if you actually need help learning.,1
"Régen játszottam vele. Műszaki dolgokkal lehet ismerkedni. A napi feladatok túl erőltetettek lettek, pont csökkent a színvonal. Volt, hogy elfelejtette a napi szériámat.",2
"In the pictures for the app, the question for the will the cup ever boil can be considered wrong, if the pressure of the air surrounding the system changes to be lower pressure  thereorectically the water in the cup will boil.",4
Helpful and challenging. Learned a lot from this app. Looking forward for better updates.,5
It doesn't teach you anything. If you get the problem wrong all it teaches you is that you're wrong. No why you're wrong. Unless you're willing to pay of course,1
cant complete login process using my google id it keeps on logging in for several hours even on a 4g connection and stable connection but i really want to use this app so please provide feedback as soon as possible,1
Wants personal data just to use. Stop using our email address and Facebook profiles. U can create apps without them!,2
A perfect place for self-development. Great brainy workouts available to explore the realms of true math.,5
Not worth the money. Everybody wants to charge you monthly fees nowadays. This app would be more appealing with a one time purchase.,2
An interesting app with some really good questions but the constant notifications (even though I have them all disabled in the settings) are so annoying that I'm uninstalling,3
"Great game! I love it, plus it makes you feel smart when you answer a question right!",5
They give you the answer but not the solution. Pay me I show you how to solve. 1 star,1
I wish to play. I do not wisb to grant access to my facebook nor google. Obviously poorly made. 0stars,1
"This is an app that lets countless people who just love math and science share the problems and the knowledge for each and everyone to solve and learn from.  An endless data base of problems, a great place to learn even the most abstract parts of math, I say it's an app that every aspiring learner should definitely try out.",5
Hoping for a educational app. Gave me a problem. I guessed wrong but I have to have a subscription to know why. Try Curiosity app. Better and free,2
Not interested in paying monthly for highschool level math. This is all easily available for free on the Internet.,2
Doesn't work for me on Android 7.0. I click on any module and it won't load. Seems cool though,2
I love being able to brush up on maths even when I know I only have a few minutes to do something. The quizzes and explainations are very effective and the process is rewarding enough to replace some of my gaming time with less will power than I expected.,5
Well i am a Brilliant user...and i love the content and interface....excellent...hey go give it a try!!!,5
I bought one month subscription for one month by reedeming my google play card but nothing has upgraded... They are fraud my 600rs are wasted...,1
"Doesn't teach you anything. Assumes too much ""prior knowledge"". poor explanations and examples.",1
"Cannot move to Sdcard and courses are for premium only. Free users have 
free tests everyday.",4
One star as it doesn't provide Free version. You should provide some section for Free users.,1
Loved it. Fantastic way to keep in touch with people who want to know more. Well done guys. Marvelous app.,5
"While it seems tempting, not going to create a new account and a new password. Make it without a login requirement and then it will be interesting.",2
Don't know if this app is good. Not going to sign up before knowing anything about it. Security risk.,1
"Exploring it. I browsed this thru web. But when I try to install on phone, I get insufficient memory. How much memory do I need?",5
Do not download is a spam i downloaded it and the day after my phone got hacked i uninstalled and tben it said virus/hacker has gone,1
This app helps some ideas for me in competition. This is very excellent app. I want to suggest to download this app who takes interest in maths. What am I say about this app . Again this is very excellently,5
Let's you play for a bit then wants 7.99 a month off you. Just another typical rip off.,1
"The app is great.... It takes u from a refrigerator to a toile bowl to the 
quantum world .....😁 great but it could have been better if it never asked 
one to pay😞 .",5
Many great logic and math problems. Fun to solve :),5
Great way to strengthen critical skills. Excellent UI and content,5
"I found all the practises easy however some did make me think, over asked my friends and watched them get it wrong which is always funny, great educational app, makes you think about the questions :) love it",5
Way too expensive for subscription. Practically nothing for free users,2
It is a medium to share and accept knowledge. You can post your own questions.,5
First Damn Question Was Bullshit... So I uninstalled right away.,1
Great app. Excellent learning experience. Must have for anyone who enjoys maths or science.,5
An excellent and helpful forum to discuss and solve science and maths problems! Keep up the good job! :),5
It's just fantastic for the studies and questions are really Damn good try it and make yourself brilliant........,5
"Really good but expensive, it doesn't need to be,  if you cut the price way down you would get more people buying it, it makes marketing sense.",5
Does a nice job from what i have seen but 8$ a month is almost a hundred a year. Way to expensive,2
"Really like the so, but just keep in mind you might have to do research 
outside of the app to get a deeper understanding on problems you couldn't 
solve.",5
Could be great for students who are looking for a fun way to learn about math and physics but students can't afford to pay for the explanations...,2
"Download the app, played less than ten minutes, and received 3 emails in my mailbox by the end of the night.",1
"Challenging, but easy to understand.  Everyone I get won't, I'm ready to kick myself.  Keeps me sharp.",5
"Yyyy esta un poco salado que te voy a decir, vi el precio de la suscripcion y me caí de traste",1
"It is fun, addicting, and challenging. 3 great qualities of a game",5
I can learn integrals and derivatives from here. Recommended for Math Olympiad,5
Another POS that insists on you creating an account or logging in with social media crapola... UNINSTALLED!,1
Shouldn't have to pay for answers. Knowledge is free.,1
"Beware, the app markets itself as free, but it quickly turns out to have a pay-to-play system in place.",1
This is why you don't download apps that want special privileges.  Deleted after less than an hour.,1
But lscks some features of Brilliant. Org,4
I love math and science. I get on this app when i'm bored.,5
Problems are very good. Even there are some notes for reference.,5
"Dont you think biology is part of science?please add basics to advance 
level of fascinating problems related to biology.Just like mathematics",4
All go for premium...useless in country like Sri Lanka (we are in a serious dollar problem)....,1
Those are the only subjects im good at!  Im terrible with history and language!,5
A premium app. Be ready to pay monthly to access various features of brilliant,2
I spent 5 minutes with it and and want that time back. The logic section is subpar at best and is incorrect.,1
"Si buscas desde consultar un tema hasta resolver problemas y examenes, esta es la mejor app. Aunque sea solo en inglés.",5
I enjoy the simplicity. Definitely a great resource for all ages.,5
"I love the app too bad it is no  longer free, I live in Pakistan so it's not really that cheap to have Brilian^2",5
Petty nice app..... It increases your brain power..... Ans is always appropriate and relevant...,5
Note 4. Says download failed try again and still won't do it,1
The idea is nice but this is definitely non free. You have to pay for 80%,2
"It's the best app to boost your problem solving skills. If you're bored 
with your daily classroom problems this the best place to go",5
I have to sign in to even play? That's a no.. Quickest uninstall ever.,1
Brilliant app is really BRILLIANT ..but if u need 1 more stars then.. U've to provide brilliant² FREE,4
Keeps emailing me saying that I have leveled up although I have uninstalled the app please fix this...,1
Excellent way of solving and learning math.                                  Sudeepto Saha,5
Unfortunately most of the time you are forced to assume things that could easily change the answer.,1
"Puzzles are repetitive,  can't get hints or the explanation of answers without paying.",2
"Ok game, but the constant emails which you can't stop are killer.",1
You need a account to play this  game how stupid is that so you can spam my e mail hell no,1
"It delivers as advertised,  I enjoy it even though I would be embarrassed to share my scores. It's thinktng-work fun.",5
"I hate this app as much as I love it .... it's cost is too much and would 
love if it were free",3
"All good stuff is locked behind a paywall, and the prices are not even reasonable.",1
"It's been a fav for a long time now......try it out! U will like it for 
sure! ;)",5
On my phone it can't load the images. Fix and I'll reconsider my review.,1
"I love this app, its amazing, u can solve many challenging problems in maths and physics, u will come to know many new things.",5
It's brilliant but you got to pay for it. This is only a demo,1
Payment option sucks. Every information is paid though good,3
"Would be kind of cool, definitely a brain tease but the fact that it's a subscription service makes it lame",2
I will give you five star if you keep a relevant price for 1 month only pack,4
"As the name suggest it is a ""Brilliant"" app for sharpening your mathematics and science problem solving skills!! Must have app for every mathematics and science loving person!",5
"This app is the only app that teach math and science, but I have to pay to 
learn everything.",2
"You have to pay money for the solutions, if you don't understand an answer",2
"For now, it's a Poorly programmed App. Utilizes much of cpu and battery.",1
Doesn't help me with jack diddly about learning the topics in the first place.,2
Was getting 2-3 spam emails a day from them. Unsubscribed and Uninstalled.,1
It tries to be Material but failed. Bring the hamburger menu!,3
Would not work at all on my phone. Kyocera Hydro.,1
Hey Brilliant is good asf but why haven't you implemented the offline mode?,1
Its light of Brilliant. Thanks#,5
"You have to pay to get your stats, who wants to pay $4 a month to play a logic game.",1
I cannot download this app with my jellybean android !!  Fix this problem,2
App sends out way too many emails and notifications.,1
"Awesome I like this. Please include more topics on different types of high 
leveled problem like robotics, aerospace, aeronautics Overall I like it",5
"In addition to advancing in levels, and a growing community, there are in principle infinite mathematical problems that can be explored—many that can be incorporated to Brilliant.",5
It ask money what for students like us.  great work anyway,5
Seemed OK but can't view solutions so what's the point?,2
"If only their was audio, It would play so well with the animation.",4
"Really awesome app.. I'd really recommend it for those who want to learn 
advance mathematics and physics.",5
It's a shame the full version of this app is so expensive because it's a fantastic app.,3
"Have very few free stuff, and then it spams your email with garbage",1
I don't want to have to sign up to use something like ever.,1
"One of the best apps ever, I have used. Just loved it!",5
Awesome App. Extremely thorough. Great to keep the ol' hamster wheel spinning.,5
A awesome app that would possibily help me to improve my solving skills,4
App would spazz out...hard to shut off...took control of phone.,2
"Man, it's cool. All science aspirants should install it and they would love it!",5
The game requires you to create an in game account or connect to FB/Google to play.,1
Why i cant see my points in new version? This new version is killing me.,4
This application will never let you be bored. I absolutely adore it!,5
"I like this app and all of its brilliant questions but the subscription is 
to expensive for an app of this kind in my opinion.",4
Too easy.  Suitable for humans with IQs below 180.,1
Best science app ever seen but the cost of premium increased from 99 per month to 600 per month . Please reduce it to previous one.,5
I would like to see this genre of gaming develop further.  Socially thought provoking.,5
It has interesting and challenging problems. Presents the problems in very innovative way.,4
Great questions that twists your. Brain,5
Good idea but I think this app needs to improve user experience.,3
Discuss solution and report buttons don't work on oppo f1s,3
Excellent app I'm in touch with the latest version. Very nice,5
"Awesome app, keeps me busy when things aren't going on well.",4
Didn't get signed in because I won't give our my pin,1
How perfect this App is we can understand throu its questionare.,4
"Awesome,but sadly its not free,I can't afford 3,600",4
"Nice only, but it can be improved more",3
Be careful of these apps that need so many permissions.,1
"Brilliant is the best platform to open the brain and get smarter! Great 
application!",5
Why do you need all of these personal permissions such as identity and contacts?  Seems shady.....,2
Skill development is really very much needed.. I think this app is giing to help in that case,5
I wanted to have such an app.. Thanks..,5
It's A very different app it is all about solving or using your mentality and to work brain as fast as it could....,5
This is a cool app. It contains all the sufficient data which is useful.,4
If u make an app make it fast enough that atleast it opens.,1
"Great app, but not paying for answers",2
"Great to get a deeper insight into every topic, Math, Science, Computer 
Science and what not!",5
"Wonderful learning app, wish I could afford to use it $$$$",1
One of the best. Why it's not totally free..,5
The app is ok but it costs money to use they should be free like school but add ads I make money in some other way,2
It's good to Explore Mathematics Calculation Easily !@@,3
Having to pay to learn a concept and correct your mistake is not impressive.,2
Do you REALLY think I am gonna pay to do math problems?,1
Business model doesn't work for me. Uninstalled.,2
Omg great app for who are always keen to be a scientist ..👳 ..,4
"Excellent app, its helping me a lot ..especially differential equation",5
That app is pretty cool.Buut it needs momey to understans the logic,2
It's useful for everyone but one thing still do hard to go with online it's better to have this app in offline,5

Awesome app very useful for the person who like maths more and useful for person appearing in JEE,5
Great app for any exam point of view and also increases the ability to approach questions,5
